# Build a Space Biology Knowledge Engine  
**Project developed by the team CTRL + Farroups for the NASA Space Apps Challenge**

---

## About the project

**NASA** is an interactive platform developed during the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**, with the goal of organizing and enabling the exploration of scientific data related to the **possibility of life in the universe**.

The site functions as a **database and research tool**, offering information on planets, satellites, habitable environments, and other astrobiological elements near Earth. These are sourced from reliable references and data provided by NASA itself. It is worth noting that this data focuses primarily on Earth, Mars, and the Moon.

The project aims to make scientific knowledge more accessible and visual, contributing to science communication and fostering interest in space.

## Features

- **Search for astrobiological data**  
  With the help of chatbots and dashboards featuring information related to Earth, Mars, and the Moon, users can gather information more efficiently and reliably than with a simple language model query or Google search.

- **Display of Earth, Moon, and Mars profiles**  
  Detailed information such as composition, distance, atmospheric conditions, and presence of water.

- **Habitability analysis**  
  Scientific criteria applied to the provided data to assess possibilities for life.

- **Interactive interface**  
  A simple and accessible layout focused on usability and clarity.

- **Integration with external sources**  
  Real data from official databases and APIs, presented in a user-friendly format.
