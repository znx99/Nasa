PARÁGRAFO: After a 16-year hiatus, Russia has resumed its program of biomedical research in space, with the successful 30-day flight of the Bion-M 1 biosatellite (April 19–May 19, 2013). The principal species for biomedical research in this project was the mouse. This paper presents an overview of the scientific goals, the experimental design and the mouse training/selection program. The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-M 1 project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-M 1 biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of “space” paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bone is a dynamically remodeled tissue that requires gravity-mediated mechanical stimulation for maintenance of mineral content and structure. Homeostasis in bone occurs through a balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by µCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 6.29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% (p = 0.004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution X-ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross-sectional area (+17%, p = 0.022), perimeter (+14%, p = 0.008), and canalicular diameter (+6%, p = 0.037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 1, 3, and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +2.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, p<0.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased 3.31 fold (p<0.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by −1.54 fold (p<0.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Microgravity, defined by minimal gravitational forces, represents a unique environment that profoundly influences biological systems, including human cells. This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as T cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differentiation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural maturation, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Therapeutic effects of adult stem-cell transplantations are limited by poor cell-retention in target organs, and a reduced potential for optimal cell differentiation compared to embryonic stem cells. However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and a novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in a stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100−300 μm) and cultured using a wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-3(+) hASCs 4.4- and 4.3-fold (2.7- and 2.9-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs.

PARÁGRAFO: The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technologies for space exploration. A key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experimentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed a novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab-2, uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real-time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes a novel fluidic RNA Sample Preparation Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab-2 validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-8. Specifically, quantitative PCR was performed on a concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on-orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth (1 g) controls. Also, on-orbit multiplex analysis of gene expression from bacterial cells and mammalian tissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about 3 h, with data transmitted within 2 h of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in a rapid follow-up on-orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release during heating cycles. The WetLab-2 facility now provides a novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body fluids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc, and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53. Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.

PARÁGRAFO: Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: One potentially important bone quality characteristic is the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) mechanical loading. In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups (n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, (p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses (p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.

PARÁGRAFO: The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor SYP41 is involved in vesicle fusion at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and interacts with AtVPS45, SYP61, and VTI12. These proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes, including vacuole biogenesis and stress tolerance. A previously uncharacterized protein, named TNO1 (for TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein), was identified by coimmunoprecipitation as a SYP41-interacting protein. TNO1 was found to localize to the TGN by immunofluorescence microscopy. A tno1 mutant showed increased sensitivity to high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, and LiCl and also to mannitol-induced osmotic stress. Localization of SYP61, which is involved in the salt stress response, was disrupted in the tno1 mutant. Vacuolar proteins were partially secreted to the apoplast in the tno1 mutant, suggesting that TNO1 is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. The tno1 mutant had delayed formation of the brefeldin A (BFA) compartment in cotyledons upon application of BFA, suggesting less efficient membrane fusion processes in the mutant. Unlike most TGN proteins, TNO1 does not relocate to the BFA compartment upon BFA treatment. These data demonstrate that TNO1 is involved in vacuolar trafficking and salt tolerance, potentially via roles in vesicle fusion and in maintaining TGN structure or identity.

PARÁGRAFO: SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with a trans-Golgi network-localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) and predicted that it should be a member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is a membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits a type II-like topology, with a single transmembrane helix and a globular domain in the C-terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi. As single atgtlp−/− mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a dynamic organelle that functions as a relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and trafficking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins.

PARÁGRAFO: Maintaining the proximity of centrosomes to nuclei is important in several cellular contexts, and LINC complexes formed by SUN and KASH proteins are crucial in this process. Here, we characterize the presumed Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian SUN protein, sperm-associated antigen 4 (Spag4, previously named Giacomo), and demonstrate that Spag4 is required for centriole and nuclear attachment during spermatogenesis. Production of spag4 mRNA is limited to the testis, and Spag4 protein shows a dynamic pattern of association with the germline nuclei, including a concentration of protein at the site of attachment of the single spermatid centriole. In the absence of Spag4, nuclei and centrioles or basal bodies (BBs) dissociate from each other after meiosis. This role of Spag4 in centriolar attachment does not involve either of the two KASH proteins of the Drosophila genome (Klarsicht and MSP-300), but does require the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Yuri shows an identical pattern of localization at the nuclear surface to Spag4 during spermatogenesis, and epistasis studies show that the activities of Yuri and dynein-dynactin are downstream of spag4 in this centriole attachment pathway. The later defects in spermatogenesis seen for yuri and spag4 mutants are similar, suggesting they could be secondary to initial disruption of events at the nuclear surface.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires better understanding of the biological consequences of long-term exposure to spaceflight. Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune-related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in a specific inability to mount a Toll-mediated infection response.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Omics data sharing is crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen a huge rise in collaborative analysis systems, databases, and knowledge bases for omics and other systems biology data. We assessed the “FAIRness” of NASA’s GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) along with four similar kinds of systems in the research omics data domain, using 14 FAIRness metrics. The range of overall FAIRness scores was 6-12 (out of 14), average 10.1, and standard deviation 2.4. The range of Pass ratings for the metrics was 29-79%, Partial Pass 0-21%, and Fail 7-50%. The systems we evaluated performed the best in the areas of data findability and accessibility, and worst in the area of data interoperability. Reusability of metadata, in particular, was frequently not well supported. We relate our experiences implementing semantic integration of omics data from some of the assessed systems for federated querying and retrieval functions, given their shortcomings in data interoperability. Finally, we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, should consider for maximizing data accessibility.

PARÁGRAFO: Background: Ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is one of the major risk factors that will impact the health of astronauts on extended missions outside the protective effects of the Earth’s magnetic field. The NASA GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal models with curated dosimetry information for spaceflight experiments. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and spaceflight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. A range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from 0.1 to 1.0 Gy for ground studies, as well as samples flown in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of 1.0 mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were able to identify distinct biological signatures associating specific ions with specific biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways as a function of dose. Conclusions: We provided a summary of how the GeneLab’s rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant hazards to the health of astronauts. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.

PARÁGRAFO: Human expansion in space is hampered by the physiological risks of spaceflight. The muscle and the liver are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight and their relationships in response to space exposure have never been studied. We compared the transcriptome response of liver and quadriceps from mice on NASA RR1 mission, after 37 days of exposure to spaceflight using GSEA, ORA, and sparse partial least square-differential analysis. We found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the two organs. A specific gene cluster expression pattern in the liver strongly correlated with glucose sparing and an energy-saving response affecting high energy demand process gene expression such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation in the muscle. Our results show that impaired lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver and muscle atrophy gene expression are two paired events during spaceflight, for which dietary changes represent a possible countermeasure.

PARÁGRAFO: The presence of humans in space has considerably increased since the beginning of space conquest and the space population is expected to continue to grow with tourism and private research activities. The NASA Artemis program plans to take humans back to the Moon for 2024, and a walk on Mars soil is estimated in the course of the 2030s (Bukley, 2020). Meanwhile, space research is driving more and more astronauts in low Earth orbit as an invaluable tool used to deepen humanity’s understanding of the universe and our place within it. But not only do humans want to visit and explore space, humans want to live in space. Outer space settlement has become a new goal of space agencies and the private sector. The Artemis program, SpaceX, the Moon Village Association, and the Mars Society are examples of the driving force of human performance in space. Recently, the USA Air Force Space Command reported eight most plausible scenarios to the year 2060, all of which anticipating a permanent occupation of the Moon surface ranging from a small-sized crew to colony of thousands of people (Air Force Space Command, 2019). Over fifty years after the first foot imprint on the lunar surface, humans could very soon become an interplanetary species.
PARÁGRAFO: This endeavor is hampered by space stressors such as space radiation, microgravity, confinement, isolation, hostile conditions, and distance from Earth, that all induce physiological changes (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). These changes can be seen as physiological adaptation to the space environment, but they can become maladaptive and deleterious over time and upon gravity re-exposure during a planetary mission such as to Mars. Nine major spaceflight systemic and physiological health risks have been identified: cardiovascular dysregulation, central nervous system impairment, increased cancer risk, muscle degeneration, bone loss, liver dysfunction and lipid dysregulation, circadian rhythm dysregulation, immune dysfunction, and space-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020). Muscle atrophy is a major risk for these missions as it impairs mobility, thus compromising critical mission operations such as post-landing vehicle egress. Muscle atrophy is characterized by unbalanced protein degradation and the loss of muscle mass. However, protein supplementation fails to counteract muscle loss in sarcopenia, cachexia, and spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy (Gao and Chilibeck, 2020). Many studies have documented spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy as a consequence of weightlessness and decreased muscle solicitation (Fitts et al., 2000). Daily exercises as countermeasures succeed in slowing down the process but the muscle still shrinks during missions. Despite the important advances in human physiology in space, the molecular mechanisms underlying these physiological changes are poorly understood. Therefore, molecular analyses are needed to enable a new countermeasure approach to monitor astronaut health and ensure safety of future habited space missions.
PARÁGRAFO: The liver and the muscle are among the most affected tissues during spaceflight. The liver and the muscle are two master organs of the metabolism, with the muscle tissue representing up to 50% of the total body mass. Consistently, astronauts and living organisms exposed to space environment display many features of dysregulated metabolism.
PARÁGRAFO: Rats on the SpaceLab-2 mission displayed increased serum cholesterol levels (Popova et al., 1999). In mice, activated lipotoxic pathways are associated with abnormal liver lipid accumulation and increased lipid metabolism and lipid localization gene expression (Jonscher et al., 2016; Beheshti et al., 2019). Beheshti et al. recently showed using a multi-omic analysis that lipid dysregulation in mice liver and lipotoxic pathways was a specific response to space stressors alone (Beheshti et al., 2019). Dysregulated lipid metabolism, especially lipid accumulation, is strongly associated with non-alcoholic fatty acid liver diseases (NAFLD), liver dysfunction, insulin resistance (IR), and diabetes (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). Of note, mice showed early signs of liver injury on a short space flight (STS-135), and subclinical diabetogenic changes have been shown to occur during spaceflight and bedrest studies (Jonscher et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2002). In mice flown aboard the BION-M1 biosatellite, the transcriptome response of the longissimus dorsi was mainly linked to metabolism, especially insulin signaling and sensitivity, highlighting the impact of spaceflight on glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle (Gambara et al., 2017a). Glucagon and insulin, two hormones of glucose metabolism, were predicted to be the common upstream regulators of spaceflight metabolic shift (Beheshti et al., 2019). In the Twin Study, increased levels of lactic acid were found in the urine of the flight astronaut, consistent with metabolomics data showing an increased lactic acid/pyruvic acid ratio suggesting a metabolic shift (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Interestingly, insulin resistance and liver diseases are associated with muscle atrophy and a potential reciprocal influence of insulin resistance and muscle disuse atrophy (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Rudrappa et al., 2016; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). As such, metabolic stress is a priority research for human space exploration (Bergouignan et al., 2016). The roles of the liver and the muscle are often interlinked, and muscle-liver crosstalk are described in metabolic diseases NAFLD, NASH, IR, and diabetes (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Soeters and Soeters, 2012). However, the relationship of the two organs in the response to space environment has not been yet elucidated.
PARÁGRAFO: In this study, we describe for the first time the relationship of the response of both the liver and the muscle of mice during spaceflight using the R software package mixOmics widely used in the omic field. The mixOmics package enables datasets comparison, correlations, and associations visualization in various research areas (Duruflé et al., 2021; González et al., 2012).
PARÁGRAFO: Previous studies showed that the muscle and the liver are differentially affected by metabolic changes during spaceflight (da Silveira et al., 2020). Here, we first investigated the commonalities between the two organs. We chose to focus on the quadriceps, which is the most important in term of size and as such potentially in terms of effects.
PARÁGRAFO: Transcriptomic data from C57BL/6J mouse liver and quadriceps from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1) protocol were analyzed by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method and visualized with Cytoscape software (Figure 1A). In the quadriceps, “fatty coA process” and “axon extension negative” were the most enriched processes. In the liver, most enriched processes were related to mitochondria (“proton triphosphate gsea”, “electron transport cytochrome”, and “mitochondrial translational elongation”) followed by lipid metabolism-related processes (“oxidation fatty acyl”, “plasma lipoprotein particle”, and “positive lipid process”) (Figure S1A, Related to Figure 1). Similarly, lipid metabolism-related pathways were also the most enriched reported by KEGG pathways over representation analysis in the liver (Figure S1B, Related to Figure 1).
PARÁGRAFO: Lipid metabolic processes are the most commonly biological processes affected in mice quadriceps and liver during spaceflight
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Cytoscape network of most common biological processes shared by the liver and the quadriceps reported by Gene Ontology biological Pathway (GOBP) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) in mice during spaceflight (p-value 0.05, FDR 0.05).

PARÁGRAFO: (C) Summary of the common KEGG GSEA pathways between mice liver and quadriceps. FDR: False Discovery Rate, GOBP: Gene Ontology Biological Process, GSEA: Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
PARÁGRAFO: Among the 24,961 transcripts identified in the liver samples and the 22,657 transcripts in the identified quadriceps sample, the most enriched gene ontology biological processes altered by spaceflight assessed by GSEA commonly shared were related to lipid metabolism (Figure 1A). “β-oxidation lipid”, “plasma lipoprotein particle”, and “triglycerides neutral biosynthetic” genesets were upregulated in both organs, while “cholesterol alcohol biosynthetic” and “fatty acyl coa” displayed opposed expression patterns between the two organs. Consistent with previous studies, mitochondria-related process genesets were also among the most shared processes and were upregulated in the liver, while downregulated in the quadriceps. Endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome-related process genesets were also among the most shared process genesets, potentially suggesting impaired protein metabolism.
PARÁGRAFO: Both positively (upregulated) and negatively (downregulated) enriched KEGG pathways obtained by GSEA for each organ were compared together in a Venn diagram (Figures 1B and 1C). Among the 70 pathways analyzed, 11 pathways were common to the two organs. Again, lipid metabolism-related pathways were the most represented among the common ones (Figure 1B), with “KEGG_BIOSYNTHESIS_OF_UNSATURED_FATTY_ACIDs” and the two short chain fatty acid metabolism pathways “KEGG_BUTANOATE_METABOLISM” and “KEGG_PROPANOATE_METABOLISM” (Figure 1C). Protein metabolism (“KEGG_RIBOSOME”, “KEGG_PROTEASOME”, “KEGG_RNA_POLYMERASE”) and DNA repair-related pathways were also among the common downregulated pathways between the two organs. Thus, spaceflights induce a strong transcriptional response of the metabolism, especially for lipid metabolism in the liver and in the quadriceps.
PARÁGRAFO: In the quadriceps, 972 genes were significantly differentially expressed, among which 562 were downregulated and 410 were upregulated. KEGG pathways over representation analysis (ORA) in the online software Webgesalt reported 30 most enriched pathways (Figure 2A). Pathways involved in metabolism are particularly enriched, especially those regulating glycemia: HIF1, ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression was decreased in flight mice compared to ground control mice (Figure 2B). Interestingly, glucose transport processes were among the most negatively enriched in GSEA reports, and glucose transport process gene expression was decreased in flight mice compared to ground control mice (Figures 2C and 2D).

PARÁGRAFO: We investigated the relationships between the downregulation of glucose transport process genes and the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathway genes using the supervised method sPLS-DA (sparse partial least square-differential analysis) with the R-mixOmics package. We compared the reported genes by the sPLS-DA performed at 100% (22657), 75% (16992), 50% (11328), and 25% (5664) (according to the process suggested in Duruflé et al., 2021) transcript input in a Venn diagram, and we found that 3463 genes were commonly reported with the strongest importance for discrimination (“discriminating genes”) (Figure S2A, Related to Figure 2). KEGG pathways ORA on these specific genes reported several enriched pathways among which were the previously mentioned hypoglycemic signaling pathways. Moreover, 491 significant differentially expressed genes (DEG) were still present among the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes, and KEGG pathway ORA on these genes demonstrated fewer enriched pathways than on the original analysis of the 972 DEG (Figure 2A) and on the 3463 sPLS-DA common genes (Figure S2A, Related to Figure 2), but the hypoglycemic ErbB, FoxO, AMPK, Insulin, and HIF-1 signaling pathways were still among the most enriched (Figure S2B, Related to Figure 2). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that inflight mice and ground control mice groups were clearly discriminated by gene variability (Figure S2C, Related to Figure 2), despite PCA being an unsupervised method. Finally, we found that glucose transport process and hypoglycemic signaling pathway gene expression correlate (Figure 2E), and this correlation is strong as indicated by the correlation intensity level shown on the correlation heatmap (Figure S2D, Related to Figure 2).
PARÁGRAFO: In the quadriceps, DNA repair, autophagy, and translation are among the most enriched processes and pathways reported by GSEA and ORA. DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process genes are decreased in inflight mice compared to ground control mice (Figures 3A–3C). Muscle glucose transport gene expression strongly correlates with decreased muscle DNA repair, autophagy, and translation process gene expression as shown by the correlation circle plot (Figures 3D–3F) and the correlation heatmap (Figures 3G–3I). These processes are both high energy demand processes. Thus, decreased energy intake gene expression correlated with an energy-saving transcriptome in mice quadriceps during spaceflight.

PARÁGRAFO: Lipid metabolism pathways are among the most reported by GSEA and ORA (Figures 1 and S1). In addition, discriminating genes after 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA and post DEG 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA still maintain this pattern as shown by KEGG ORA (Figures S3A and S3B, Related to Figure 4). Of note, the two short chain fatty acid “butanoate” and ‘propanoate” were always among the most enriched KEGG pathways (Figure S3C, Related to Figure 4). Since fatty liver diseases are associated with IR and diabetes, we investigated whether altered glucose transport gene expression was linked to liver lipid metabolism. We found that glucose transport process gene expression strongly correlated with liver lipid metabolism gene expression during spaceflight (Figures 4B and 4C). Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression also correlated with muscle autophagy, DNA repair, and translation process gene expression (Figures 5A–5C). Furthermore, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression (Figure 5D). Indeed, liver lipid metabolism and muscle atrophy genes formed a gene correlation network (Figure 5E). Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1 formed a gene cluster strongly correlating with muscle gene expression (Figure 5F).

PARÁGRAFO: Despite the systemic and physiological health risk of spaceflight, it is a fact that humans have become a space-faring species. Muscle atrophy has been shown to occur in both weightlessness and bed rest studies. The decreased gravity load on the locomotive apparatus is often presented as the main driver of muscle atrophy and bone loss. Previous studies showed that mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism were impaired in both astronauts and mice during spaceflight. Da Silveira and colleagues previously showed that a mitochondrial stress is a central hub for spaceflight-induced physiological changes (da Silveira et al., 2020). Mitochondria are complex organelles inside the cell where fundamental biomolecules are metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and coupled to energy production by the electron transport chain. Thus, mitochondria play a key role in metabolism and energy management. Here, we found that lipid metabolism is the most affected biological process between the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome in mice during spaceflight. Impaired lipid metabolism and fatty acid accumulation is associated with muscle atrophy. Of note, butanoate and propanoate metabolism were the most affected in the two organs analyzed, decreased in the liver while increased in the muscle. Butanoate and propanoate, also known as butyrate and propionate, are short chain fatty acids produced in the intestinal lumen by bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, especially resistant starch, dietary fiber, and to a lesser extent proteins. Resistant starch is found in some grains, beans, and legumes. The gut microbiome is disturbed during spaceflight; astronauts’ gut microbiome showed an alteration in the composition pattern of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, the main butyrate-producing bacteria in the human gut (Venegas et al., 2019), with the presence of different genus increasing or decreasing during spaceflight but also showing a consistent decrease in bacteria from the taxa Pseudobutyrivibrio and Akkermansia, also known to produce butyrate in the intestine (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Voorhies et al., 2019; Venegas et al., 2019). Microbiome analysis from RR1 mice showed an overall increase of bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, but the authors linked that to similar alterations that occur with aging (Jiang et al., 2019). This Firmicute increase in older mice is seen as a sign of dysbiosis and this alteration was shown to be followed by a ∼70% decrease in butyrate levels (Spychala et al., 2018). The upregulation of butyrate and propionate pathways in the muscle can reflect a possible need for these fatty acids and derivatives. In this context, dietary changes could represent a feasible countermeasure to spaceflight-induced physiological changes.
PARÁGRAFO: The TCA cycle activity and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ratio are decreased in muscle during spaceflight suggesting disturbed energy production. Consistently, we found that spaceflight induced a hyperglycemic response in mouse muscle involving the downregulation of hypoglycemic signaling pathways downstream of the insulin receptor (HIF, ErbB, AMPK, FoxO, and PI3K-Akt). This signaling response mostly affected glucose import gene expression. In addition, high energy demand processes such as DNA repair, autophagy, and translation gene expression were decreased in inflight mice quadriceps, suggesting a shift toward an energy-saving mode in the muscle during spaceflight. The muscle is a high energy demand organ. Since the muscle represent up to 50% of the total body mass, its metabolism radically affects glucose availability in the body. Consequently, glucose sparing and energy saving by the muscle in detrimental conditions can compensate for the energy needs of other such as the brain that requires stable and continuous glucose supply. Oxidative stress and DNA damage overload, that can impair mitochondrial function and the metabolism, are examples of detrimental conditions occurring during spaceflight (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Also, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to muscle atrophy (Abrigo et al., 2019). The HIF-1 signaling enriched pathways suggest that oxidative stress occurred in RR1 inflight mice. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction promote insulin resistance and diabetes (Bashan et al., 2009; Di Meo et al., 2017; Sivitz and Yorek, 2010). Our results, in line with previous space studies, suggest an insulin resistance phenotype. Meanwhile, insulin resistance has been proposed as an evolutionary mechanism to spare glucose that can benefit survival in various states such as starvation, immune activation growth, and cancer (Soeters and Soeters, 2012).
PARÁGRAFO: Insulin resistance and diabetes are often associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism and liver diseases. Fatty acids inhibit the insulin signaling pathways by directly interfering in the signaling through diacylglycerol or by overloading the TCA with the precursor acetyl CoA (Kovacs and Stumvoll, 2005; Perry et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2010). During spaceflight, liver lipid metabolic gene expression correlated with muscle glucose import gene expression in RR1 mice. Insulin resistance, NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cirrhosis are associated with muscle atrophy and their severity correlates positively (Chakravarthy et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2020; Samuel and Shulman, 2012). During a stress starvation, fatty acids together with ketone bodies become the primary source of energy for cells while peripheral organs such as the muscle, but also the skin and bones, provide amino acids taken up by central organs such as the liver, the spleen, immune cells, and healing tissues, ultimately leading to protein loss (Soeters and Soeters, 2012). During a spaceflight, all cells are exposed to space stressors such as radiation, endocrine system perturbation induced by altered circadian rhythm or psychological issues, and microgravity, all promoting oxidative stress, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, it has been shown that spaceflight induces a shift from slow aerobic and highly enriched mitochondria muscle fibers (“slow fiber”, “type I”) toward fast anaerobic and fast low-enriched mitochondria muscle fiber (“fast fiber”, “type II”) (Gambara et al., 2017b; Ulanova et al., 2015). Mitochondria are the major source of reactive oxygen species. As such, spaceflight-induced fiber shift and mitochondrial dysfunction can be seen as a biological mechanism to decrease mitochondrial activity and mitigate oxidative stress. If mitochondrial stress is a central biological hub during spaceflight, and if the mitochondria are the master organelle of metabolism regulation and energy management, we can then expect a general metabolic shift in the body toward a starvation-like phenotype that promotes decreased mitochondrial activity, decreased metabolism and protein loss in the muscle, and increased lipid metabolism in the liver, to the benefit of all body cells during spaceflight. Consistently, liver lipid metabolism gene expression strongly correlated with muscle DNA repair, autophagy, translation, and finally muscle atrophy phenotype gene expression. Butanoate and propanoate metabolism-related genes were still among the one with the strongest correlation. Interestingly, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation improve mitochondrial function, fat accumulation, insulin resistance, diabetes, and liver diseases (Gao et al., 2009; Khan and Jena, 2016; Mollica et al., 2017; Ye et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2018). Moreover, sodium butyrate and butyrate diet supplementation decreased muscle atrophy in various conditions (Chang et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2022; Walsh et al., 2015). Thus, butyrate supplementation or dietary modification to stimulate microbial production represents simple options to counteract muscle atrophy while preventing insulin resistance and lipid accumulation during spaceflight.
PARÁGRAFO: Gambara et al. previously identified insulin- and glucose metabolism-linked transcripts as main DEG in BION-M1 biosatellite flown mice longissimus dorsi. In the present study, 17 and 13 differentially expressed genes in the liver and the muscle, respectively, were common to the 89 previously identified (Gambara et al., 2017a). Acas1a, Cpt2, Agt, Lcn2, and Prkcd, which were among the most DEG in Gambara’s study were not found significantly differentially expressed neither in the liver nor the quadriceps in the present study. The present study is based on the analyses of discriminating genes identified by the spls-DA performed with the mixOmics script. This method is designed to identify variations that are correlated, here gene expression in the liver and gene expression in the quadriceps. Also, 31 over the 9753, among which Agt and Cpt2, and 24 over the 3463 discriminating genes in the liver and the quadriceps, respectively, were in common with the 89 of the Gambara’s study. These differences may reflect the variability of gene expression between the different muscle types. Nonetheless, in line with the literature, both converge to an altered insulin transcriptome, thus highlighting a general adaptive response in muscle during spaceflight despite different molecular pathways. Moreover, the present study highlights the importance of discriminating genes over DEG in deciphering omic data. We found that discriminating genes are mainly linked to lipid metabolism in the liver and insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in the quadriceps. This means that lipid metabolism gene expression in the liver correlates with insulin signaling and glucose metabolism gene expression in the quadriceps in mice during spaceflight. We identified a cluster of lipid metabolism processes-related genes in the liver, including Akr1c12, Ces1c, Abcg8, Abcg5, Fabp2, Apom, Rdh7, Serpina6, Gpat2, and Slc10a1, correlating the most with glucose transport gene expression and potentially insulin resistance in the muscle. Among these genes, some are already described for their insulin sensitivity. Fabp2, Abcg5, and Abcg8 genes polymorphisms are associated with insulin sensitivity while Apom might protect against insulin resistance (Gylling et al., 2004; Kurano et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2020). Interestingly, Sestrin 1 (Sesn1), a well-known regulator of cell metabolism upregulated in longissimus dorsi of BION-M1 mice, was reported as a discriminating gene in both the liver and the quadriceps (Gambara et al., 2017a). Sestrin proteins are involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and insulin signaling (Lee et al., 2013). Sesn1 together with the present lipid metabolism-related gene cluster may thus account in insulin resistance research.
PARÁGRAFO: The liver influence on quadriceps gene expression we identified needs to be carried out by organ communication mechanisms and we identified hepatokines as the most likely effector. Hepatokines are proteins secreted by the liver that can modulate signaling pathways associated with energy metabolism in the muscle and influence the development of chronic metabolic diseases (Seo et al., 2021). Important for our context, an increased blood concentration of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin increases insulin sensitivity, muscle hypertrophy, and mitochondrial function and diminishes fat mass in the muscle (Seo et al., 2021). Interestingly, increased concentration of Fetuin-A showed to have the inverse effect of the previously described hepatokines (Jensen-Cody and Potthoff, 2021; Seo et al., 2021). The levels of Fetuin-A increase after 60 day of bed rest, a ground model for microgravity effects, and we found in the literature a positive correlation between the Fetuin-A levels and the gene expression of Serpina6 and Rdh7, two genes we identified in our gene cluster (Herrmann et al., 2020; Thakur et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2020). Interestingly, Fetuin-A, as well as FGF21 and ANGPTL4 genes are among the correlating genes in the liver of mice during spaceflight reported by the liver versus quadriceps sPLS-DA. We hypothesize that the gene expression correlation identified in our work likely involves an increased Fetuin-A production by the liver and a diminished production of FGF21, ANGPTL4, FST, and Andropin.
PARÁGRAFO: In conclusion, we described for the first time a strong correlation between liver lipid metabolism gene expression and the downregulation of hypoglycemic and energy demand process-related genes. In the light of current knowledge, our result suggests that a starvation-like phenotype could promote a metabolic shift toward an energy-saving mode, resource sparring, and lipid mobilization through a tight liver-muscle crosstalk contributing to muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Dietary changes based on starch supplementation and microbiome modulation represent an affordable and sustainable countermeasure to support our planetary goals and outer space settlement. Meanwhile, improving food habits and body energy monitoring is an overall human challenge both on Earth and beyond.
PARÁGRAFO: Sample size was only six mice to match sample availability in the quadriceps and the liver transcriptome. Future space studies should be designed to match individuals for any factors (organs, environmental parameters, psychological parameters, etc.).
PARÁGRAFO: Here, we studied biological processes and pathways at a transcriptional level. Transcription regulation, post-transcriptional stabilization, and post-translational modifications impact cell response from gene expression to the final protein activity. In addition, transcriptomics provides a static view of one single moment in the cell. However, spatial repartition also impacts molecular dynamics, and a transcriptional ecosystem theory has been defined (Silveira and Bilodeau, 2018). To further understand the biological significance of the transcriptomic response to spaceflight in mice quadriceps, both functional analysis and multi-omics studies are needed.
PARÁGRAFO: Additional factors account for inducing muscle atrophy during spaceflight. Circadian rhythm pathways genes are among those enriched in both the quadriceps and the liver in mice during spaceflight (Figure S1B, Related to Figures 1 and 2A), and circadian rhythm perturbation is associated with muscle atrophy (Choi et al., 2020). Astronauts experience continuous circadian rhythm stressors on board the ISS, with sixteen sunsets per day and sustained artificial light exposure as the only illumination source. However, assessing and deciphering circadian rhythm dynamics and correlation at molecular levels require proper protocol and experimental design (Zeitgeber time method) that should be implemented in future space biology research.
PARÁGRAFO: We used the method implemented in mixOmics between the same molecular variables. This method is a powerful tool to compare any types of datasets. In this context, multiple variables comparisons, e.g., temperature variation inside the spacecrafts, food intake levels, dietary type, cognitive performances, psychological parameters, and allowing multiscale comparisons, will considerably widen our understanding of spaceflight’s impact on living organisms. The list of possible datasets combinations is infinite, as much as the number of studies which can raise from.

PARÁGRAFO: The omics data of mice liver and muscle were obtained from the NASA Rodent Research 1 (RR1) protocol accessible on the NASA’s GeneLab public omics repository. Also, all animal procedures, ethics, and tissues harvesting, disposal, and experiments have been previously conducted and performed by external experimenters. Thus, animal procedures were performed according to the relevant guide-lines at each institution and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Full experimental procedures are available at: https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ and https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168.
PARÁGRAFO: Briefly, the study was conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2014 on twelves female C57BL/6J mice, six in flight mice (M23, M24, M25, M26, M27, M28) referred to as the FLT group, and six ground controls mice (M33, M34, M35, M36, M37, M38), referred to as the GC group, for 37 days upon 12h day/night cycle, and fed with Nutrient Upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB)63. The research platform used for this experiment was NASA’s Rodent Research Hardware System also referred to as the Rodent Research Habitat System. Mice were sacrificed with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation on orbit on the ISS for the FLT group, and on the ground at the same time for the GC group. The entire carcasses of 10 mice were stored at −80C until processing. Two FLT mice were dissected on-board the ISS, and livers were isolated on-orbit and stored in the MELFI. Frozen FLT mice carcasses were then returned on Earth by the SpaceX-4 spacecraft and delivered to the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) for disposal. The ten frozen mice carcasses, GC and FLT, were dissected at room temperature, and harvested samples stored at −80C.
PARÁGRAFO: RNA extraction from 20–30mg mice liver and muscle were realized at 4C using a lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and a beta-mercaptoethanol (1:100)/Buffer RLT solution, lysis buffer (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and kept on ice. Samples were then homogenized for 20 s at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 min at room temperature to remove tissue debris. RNA from homogenates were further purified using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and eluted in DNase/RNase-free water. RNA concentrations were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). RNA sequencing and library construction was performed on 1 μg of RNA having RIN values of 7 or above, using Illumina HiSeq 4000 kit and experimental protocol.
PARÁGRAFO: Raw FASTQ files were proceed using the “GeneLab RNAseq data processing protocol” as reported at https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-103/ and https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/accession/GLDS-168. On this work we used the mentioned protocol up to the step “Quantification data was imported to R (version 3.6.0) with tximport”.
PARÁGRAFO: Differential Expression (DE) analysis has been performed using the R studio software Version 1.2.5001 and the DESeq2 package version 1.30.1 that uses shrinkage estimation for dispersion and fold change. RSEM expected counts were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. Statistical significance of differentially expressed genes (FDR ≤0.05) were assessed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment procedure.
PARÁGRAFO: For biological process, pathways, networks and clusters analysis, normalized count from RR1 mice quadriceps and liver were processed by the DEseq2 package and assessed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways Over Representation Analysis on the online Webgesalt platform, and for Gene Ontology Biological Process (GOBP) and KEGG pathways GeneSets Enrichment by the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) software. The Cytoscape software was used to build geneset networks from GSEA results. GSEAs were run with a ‘‘Flight vs Ground Control’’ comparison setting. The ranked list of genes was defined by the signal-to-noise metric, and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the gene sets. Enrichment importance were sorted according to the enrichment score calculated by GSEA (Müller, 2019). Venn diagrams were generated on the online platform Venny available at: https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index2.0.2.html.
PARÁGRAFO: mixomics is a R package developed by Kim-anh Lê Cao, Sébastien Déjean and collaborators to visualize associations between paired omics datasets using correlation circles plots, heatmaps, and networks (Duruflé et al., 2021; González et al., 2012; Rohart et al., 2017). In the present study we used mixOmics package version 6.14.1. More information can be found on the online mixOmics platform available at: http://mixomics.org/.
PARÁGRAFO: Transcriptome from 6 matched NASA RR1 mice, 3 ground controls (M36, M37, M38) and 3 inflight (M25, M26, M28), between the liver and the quadriceps were analyzed by sPLS (Partial Least Square) and sPLS-DA (sparse Partial Least Square-Differential Analysis). Correlation circle and correlation network were generated from sPLS-DA performed on 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% of total normalized counts according to the process suggested in Duruflé et al. (2021). This method is an internal method to validate that the pattern of genes evaluated with the strongest importance for discrimination maintain across input reduction. These genes are referred to as to “discriminating genes” in this study. The correlation circle plot is a 1 sized radius were variable pools located between |0,5| and |1| have the strongest correlation. Correlation heatmaps are generated from sPLS analyses. Post 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA DEG are DEG still present in reported genes from 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% sPLS-DA.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Despite surging interest in space travel in recent decades, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to DNA structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on DNA methylation. Building on previous work by Kennedy et al. (Sci Rep 8(1): 6709. 10.1038/S41598-018-24755-8), we evaluated spatial DNA methylation patterns triggered by high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation and the influence of chromosome positioning and epigenetic architecture in distinct radial layers of cell nucleus. Next, we validated our results using gene expression data of mice irradiated with simulated GCR and JAXA astronauts. We showed that primarily 56Fe induces a persistent DNA methylation increase whereas 28Si and X-ray induce a decrease DNA methylation which is not persistent with time. Moreover, we highlighted the role of nuclear chromatin architecture in cell response to external radiation. In summary, our study provides novel insights towards epigenetic and transcriptomic response as well as chromatin multidimensional structure influence on galactic cosmic radiation damage.

PARÁGRAFO: COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has caused significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of a three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Human space exploration poses inherent risks to astronauts’ health, leading to molecular changes that can significantly impact their well-being. These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Our previous research revealed a key microRNA signature that is associated with spaceflight that can be used as a biomarker and to develop countermeasure treatments to mitigate the damage caused by space radiation. Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and transcriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (0.5 Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p (i.e., antagomirs). Significant reduction of inflammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our findings indicate a countermeasure strategy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in spaceflight missions to mitigate space radiation damage.

PARÁGRAFO: Mounting ambitions and capabilities for public and private, non-government sector crewed space exploration bring with them an increasingly diverse set of space travelers, raising new and nontrivial ethical, legal, and medical policy and practice concerns which are still relatively underexplored. In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Primary root growth is required by the plant to anchor in the soil and reach out for nutrients and water, while dealing with obstacles. Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is a highly plastic network that constitutes a point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present a detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin-disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as a hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by a plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still a large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with a focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating a potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains a lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1, and analyses of a hlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of the TGN/EE at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants.

PARÁGRAFO: Root hairs are single-cell cylindrical projections that expand the effective radius of the root. In doing so, they play crucial roles in the uptake of water and nutrients from the soil, especially under conditions in which such resources are limiting (Carminati et al., 2017). Root hairs expand by tip growth, a process that involves the targeted delivery and secretion of vesicles to the cell apex. As a result, root hairs attain lengths that are several times their widths (Chebli et al., 2013). In tip-growing cells, cargo transported by tip-targeted vesicles consist of an assortment of carbohydrate precursors that are needed for the assembly and remodeling of the apical cell wall (Gu and Nielsen, 2013). Research spanning several decades has led to the identification of multiple components of the tip growth machinery including protein modulators of cytoskeletal organization, membrane trafficking, cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) signaling, and phosphoinositide metabolism (Cole and Fowler, 2006; Rounds and Bezanilla, 2013).
PARÁGRAFO: In recent years, plant malectin-like receptor kinases, also known as Catharanthus roseus receptor-like kinases (CrRLK1Ls; Franck et al., 2018), have been shown to regulate tip growth in root hairs and pollen tubes (Duan et al., 2010; Bai et al., 2014; Haruta et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2017; Schoenaers et al., 2018). In one noteworthy study, Bai et al. (2014) reported that a CrRLK1L, which they named [Ca2+]cyt-associated protein kinase 1 (CAP1), modulates root hair growth by maintaining ammonium (NH4+) homeostasis. CAP1 is also known as ERULUS (ERU), named after the son of FERONIA (FER), a widely studied member of the CrRLK1L family (Haruta et al., 2014). In Arabidopsis thaliana, cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants have short and irregularly shaped root hairs consistent with a role of CAP1/ERU as a positive regulator of root hair growth (Bai et al., 2014; Haruta et al., 2014; Schoenaers et al., 2018). Bai et al. (2014) proposed a model wherein CAP1/ERU functions in maintaining root hair growth under high NH4+ environments by sensing cytoplasmic NH4+. Sensing of cytoplasmic NH4+ by CAP1/ERU then triggers signaling events that lead to NH4+ sequestration into the vacuole, making it less toxic to the cell. The model postulates that toxic levels of NH4+ accumulate in the cytoplasm of cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants, resulting in the disappearance of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients, and because of this lack of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients, their root hairs cease to expand (Bai et al., 2014). In this letter, we question the proposed role of CAP1/ERU in NH4+ homeostasis based on our studies of a new eru-3 mutant allele, showing that CAP1/ERU is instead localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and its function is linked to tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations. This is further supported by recent work on the eru-2 mutant by Schoenaers et al. (2018), as described below.
PARÁGRAFO: A major result used to support the CAP1/ERU-NH4+ homeostasis model was the observation that a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion localized to the tonoplast. According to the model, the tonoplast-localized CAP1/ERU is what senses cytoplasmic NH4+, resulting in its compartmentalization into the vacuole (Bai et al., 2014).
PARÁGRAFO: We independently isolated the recessive eru-3 mutant in a forward-genetic screen for root hair mutants that resembled wild-type root hairs treated with low concentrations of the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin B. Here, we refer to our mutant as eru-3 following the nomenclature of Haruta et al. (2014), in which two mutant alleles of eru were first described as eru-1 and eru-2. The cap1 mutant (SALK_083442) studied by Bai et al. (2014) is similar to eru-2; therefore, we refer to it here as cap1/eru-2 (Figure 1A). When we expressed an ERU-GFP construct under the control of the constitutive UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter (UBQ10:ERU-GFP) in the eru-3 mutants, their root hairs were restored to wild-type lengths, indicating that the fusion protein was functional (Figures 1B and 1C).

PARÁGRAFO: (F) Scatterplot showing that fluorescence of ERU-GFP is positively correlated with growth rate of root hairs (P < 2.2 × 10−6). The same data were plotted in (E) and (F). See detailed methods in supplemental data.
PARÁGRAFO: We found that instead of localizing to the root hair tonoplast, ERU-GFP marked the PM at the site of root hair bulges. As root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth, the ERU-GFP signal intensified and formed a diffuse fluorescent cap at the root hair apex (Figure 1D). Distal to the root hair tip, ERU-GFP decorated distinct and dynamic puncta that were reminiscent of post-Golgi and endocytic vesicles (Figure 1D). As root hairs matured and ceased growth, the intensity of ERU-GFP at the tip declined (Figure 1D). Time-course and correlation analyses revealed that tip-directed accumulation of ERU-GFP was most intense in root hairs that grew rapidly (Figures 1E and 1F), supporting the role of ERU as a positive regulator of root hair tip growth.
PARÁGRAFO: It is important to note that Bai et al. (2014) used transient expression of a CAP1/ERU-GFP fusion in protoplasts and onion epidermal cells to conclude that it localized to the tonoplast, and the functionality of their CAP1/ERU-GFP construct was not validated in root hairs. It is possible that their CAP1/ERU-GFP was mislocalized because it was expressed in cell types (i.e., leaf protoplasts and onion epidermal cells) in which ERU is not typically found. We attempted to express ERU-GFP in the eru-3 mutant under the control of the native ERU promoter (ERUpro) consisting of 626 bp upstream of the ERU gene. Unfortunately, we were unable to recover ERUpro:ERU-GFP lines. However, it was recently reported that a 2529-bp sequence that included the ERU promoter coupled to the ERU coding and GFP sequence (ERUp:ERU-GFP) complemented cap1/eru-2 root hairs (Schoenaers et al., 2018). This group found that expressed ERU-GFP localized to root hairs in a similar manner as our constitutively expressed ERU-GFP, further supporting our conclusion that the PM is where the ERU protein resides.
PARÁGRAFO: Another major result of Bai et al. (2014) that we address in this letter is their finding that root hairs of cap1/eru loss-of-function mutants appeared to lack tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients. We feel that it is important to address these results because they provide an example of how [Ca2+]cyt imaging data on root hairs can be misinterpreted. For these experiments, it is critical to note that root hair growth ceases when the large central vacuole protrudes toward the cell apex (Grierson et al., 2014). Furthermore, mature, nongrowing root hairs in which the vacuole protrudes to the apex have been shown to lack [Ca2+]cyt gradients (Wymer et al., 1997). The images of cap1/eru-2 root hairs that Bai et al. (2014) presented as the basis for extracting their [Ca2+]cyt data (Figures 2A and 3C in Bai et al. [2014]) clearly showed the vacuole protruding to the apex. Based on the above observations, we would not expect to find [Ca2+]cyt gradients in such root hairs. We expressed the intensiometric [Ca2+]cyt reporter G-CAMP3 (Tian et al., 2009) in eru-3 to assess if their root hairs lacked a [Ca2+]cyt gradient. We were careful to sample [Ca2+]cyt only in root hairs that had a dense cytoplasm at the cell apex.
PARÁGRAFO: In contrast to the results of Bai et al. (2014), we found that eru-3 root hairs that still had a substantial cytoplasm at the apex did not lack tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt gradients. These eru-3 root hairs were still elongating, albeit at a significantly reduced rate when compared with the wild type (∼0.20 μm/min for eru-3 versus 1 μm/min for the wild type). However, we did observe that patterns of tip [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in these slow growing eru-3 root hairs were compromised. Compared with the wild type, root hairs of eru-3 had more prolonged periods of elevated tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt followed by longer periods of dampened [Ca2+]cyt (Figures 2A to 2C; Supplemental Movie 1). Quantitative analysis of [Ca2+]cyt following the fast Fourier transform methods described by Schoenaers et al. (2018) showed that eru-3 displayed low frequency [Ca2+]cyt oscillations. The main frequency of [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in eru-3 root hairs was 0.003 ± 0.0002 Hz compared with 0.044 ± 0.0184 Hz in the wild type (Figure 2D). Furthermore, the amplitude of [Ca2+]cyt oscillation at the tips of eru-3 was ∼3-fold higher than the wild type (Figure 2E). These results are in agreement with findings of Schoenaers et al. (2018) in which they showed decreased frequency and increased amplitude of pectin Ca2+ binding site oscillations in cap1/eru-2 root hairs. It is clear from our results that ERU is important for normal tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations, a process that is crucial for sustained root hair growth (Monshausen et al., 2008). Mechanistic links between PM-localized ERU and the maintenance of [Ca2+]cyt oscillations are unknown. However, demonstrating the true nature of tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt defects in eru-3 root hairs enables the development of more accurate models that could be tested in the future to explain how ERU modulates tip growth.

PARÁGRAFO: In light of the ERU localization data presented here and those reported by Schoenaers et al. (2018), the model by Bai et al. (2014), proposing that tonoplast-based NH4+ signaling is the major driver for ERU-mediated tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations and root hair growth, needs reexamination. Other CrRLK1Ls, such as FER, THESEUS1, HERCULES1, ANXUR, and BUDDHA’s PAPER SEAL, have all been shown to localize to the PM (Escobar-Restrepo et al., 2007; Hématy et al., 2007; Boisson-Dernier et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2009; Miyazaki et al., 2009; Duan et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2017). Our results and those of Schoenaers et al. (2018) clearly demonstrate that ERU is also a PM-localized CrRLK1L and should no longer be referred to as a vacuolar membrane-localized protein.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating two-dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) is a well-characterized second messenger in eukaryotic cells. An elevation in [Ca2+]cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to a range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cyt in plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauliflower Mosaic Virus (35S) and Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce a set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in five root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and differences in the [Ca2+]cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide a new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how a particular environmental stimulus is linked to specific root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Root hairs are single-cell protrusions that enable roots to optimize nutrient and water acquisition. These structures attain their tubular shapes by confining growth to the cell apex, a process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI), a beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane trafficking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (W/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compartments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and filamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the localization data, tip growth was reduced in spi and the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in brk1 and scar1234. BRK1 depletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers a role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with W/SC.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Long-duration spaceflight creates a variety of stresses due to the unique environment, which can lead to compromised functioning of the skeletal and immune systems. However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6 g [lunar gravity], and 1 g) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25–35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1 g but only partially recovered by 1/6 g. Both 1 g and 1/6 g suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g, but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6 g. While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight.

PARÁGRAFO: While the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is the best studied biological mechanosensor and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension, the simple matter of its oligomeric state has led to debate, with models ranging from tetramers to hexamers. Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by X-ray crystallography: The M. tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) is a pentamer, while the S. aureus protein (SaMscL) forms a tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the E. coli MscL (EcoMscL) is a pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed a disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that SaMscL is a pentamer when solubilized in Triton X-100 and C8E5 detergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by X-ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish a membrane protein's true functionally relevant oligomeric state.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: MscL is a bacterial mechanosensor that serves as a biological emergency release valve, releasing cytoplasmic solutes to the environment on osmotic downshock. Previous studies have recognized that this channel has properties that make it ideal for use as a triggered nanovalve for vesicular-based targeted drug-release devices. One can even change the modality of the sensor. Briefly, the introduction of charges into the MscL pore lumen gates the channel in the absence of membrane tension; thus, by inserting compounds that acquire a charge on exposure to an alternative stimulus, such as light or pH, into the pore of the channel, controllable nanoswitches that detect these alternative modalities have been engineered. However, a charge in the pore lumen could not only encourage actuation of the nanopore but also have a significant influence on the permeation of large charged compounds, which would thus have important implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices. In this study, we used in vivo and electrophysiological approaches to demonstrate that the introduction of a charge into pore lumen of MscL does indeed influence the permeation of charged molecules. These effects were more drastic for larger compounds and, surprisingly, were related to the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane.—Yang, L-M, Blount, P. Manipulating the permeation of charged compounds through the MscL nanovalve.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from E. coli serves as an emergency release valve allowing the cell to survive acute osmotic downshock. It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as a paradigm for how a protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs M. tuberculosis and S. aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was a species difference or a consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length S. aureus MscL is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the C-terminal region of S. aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of S. aureus MscLs with different C-terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric S. aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo. Thus, the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus protein only plays a critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein when it is solubilized in detergent.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: MscL is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment. It is one of the best characterized mechanosensors known, thus serving as a paradigm of how such molecules sense and respond to stimuli. In addition, the fact that it can be genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its proposed use as a triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug release. X-ray crystallography reveals a homo-pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) and a single carboxyl terminal α-helix arranging within the complex to form a five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as a paradigm for how proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens a large pore upon a sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. A crystal structure of a closed state of MscL shows it as a homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An N-terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2ci), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of E. coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated a map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest a model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life-threatening changes that can occur is that of a rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without a protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive channels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly a function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physiological roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function.

PARÁGRAFO: MscL, the highly conserved bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, functionally serves as an osmotic “emergency release valve”, is among the best studied mechanosensors and a paradigm of how a channel senses and responds to membrane tension. While all homologues tested thus far encode channel activity, many show functional differences. Here we tested E. coli and S aureus chimeras and find that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly E. coli I49 and the equivalent S aureus F47 at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, drastically influences both the open dwell time and threshold of channel opening. One mutant shows a severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating. We propose that this site acts similar to a spring for a clasp knife, adjusting the resistance for obtaining and stabilizing an open or closed channel structure.
PARÁGRAFO: Keywords: mechanosensitive channel, channel kinetics, osmoregulation, protein-lipid interactions
PARÁGRAFO: The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch, hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. The best-studied mechanosensitive channels are from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are a model for how a protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces.
PARÁGRAFO: The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that is gated by membrane tension (Blount et al., 2008a; Blount et al., 2007; Blount et al., 2008b; Booth and Blount, 2012). Although observed in the vast majority of bacterial species, the channels from Escherichia coli (E. coli) have been the best studied. The physiological role of MscL, and members of an unrelated bacterial mechanosensitive channel family, MscS (S for small conductance), is to serve as biological “emergency release valves” to protect cells from lysis upon an acute decrease in osmotic environment, commonly referred to as osmotic downshock; it accomplishes this by rapidly releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes (Booth and Blount, 2012; Levina et al., 1999). The MscL channel is less sensitive than MscS to membrane tension, but it generates a larger pore size, upwards of 30Å (Cruickshank et al., 1997), suggesting it is the last-ditch effort for survival. The MscL family is highly conserved and has a simple structural organization (Balleza and Gomez-Lagunas, 2009; Pivetti et al., 2003). This exaggerated response and simple construction lends itself as a paradigm for how MS channels, in general, can sense and respond to membrane stretch.
PARÁGRAFO: X-ray crystallography has resolved a MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tb-MscL) to be a homopentamer with each subunit containing an amphipathic N-terminal cytoplasmic α-helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by the two transmembrane α-helices (TM1 and TM2) that are connected by a periplasmic loop, and ending with the five C-terminal α-helixes forming a cytoplasmic helical bundle (Chang et al., 1998; Steinbacher et al., 2007) (also see Fig. 1A). A more recent structure has also been resolved for the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) MscL orthologue (Sa-MscL), which shows a tetrameric rather than pentameric complex (Liu et al., 2009); however, this appears to be a detergent-induced oligomeric rearrangement since the channel forms almost exclusively pentamers in vivo (Dorwart et al., 2010; Iscla et al., 2011). Although the Sa-MscL structure is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, it is worth noting that many of the interactions between the transmembrane domains are similar to those observed in the Tb-MscL crystal structure, suggesting an overall structural conservation within this highly conserved family.
PARÁGRAFO: A: Crystal structure of Tb-MscL. a homopentamer with each subunit having two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) connected by periplasmic loop (peri-loop) marked in blue, an N-terminal cytoplasmic helix (S1) connected to TM1, and a C-terminal cytoplasmic helical bundle connected to TM2 by a short cytoplasmic loop. The amino acid shown in red is G47 in Tb- MscL, which is equivalent to F47 in S. aureus and I49 in E. coli MscL. B. Sequence alignment of MscL homologs from E. coli (Eco-MscL) and S. aureus (Sa-MscL). Included in blue boxes are identical and similar residues in the E. coli and S. aureus MscL protein. The arrows and bold labels show the identified analogous amino acid in Eco- and Sa-MscL. The schematic illustration of MscL is also shown above the sequence alignment with S1, TM1, TM2 and c-terminal helix domains shown as boxes and periplasmic and cytoplasmic loops shown as lines.
PARÁGRAFO: Although highly homologous, MscL channels from different species can vary in threshold of activation, conductance and open dwell time (Folgering et al., 2005; Maurer et al., 2000; Moe et al., 1998). For example, Sa-MscL has a sequence identity of 47% and similarity of 69% with E. coli MscL (Eco-MscL) (Fig. 1B); however, the major physiological differences between the activities of these channels is that the Sa-MscL has much shorter open dwell times (Moe et al., 1998) and requires greater membrane tension to open. To identify the structural features underlying these functional differences, we have generated chimeras in which we have exchanged protein domains, subdomains, and ultimately even individual amino acids, and determined the kinetics and threshold of activation of the resulting channels. Surprisingly, the data indicate that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly one residue located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, plays a major role in both the open dwell time and threshold of activation, or, for simplicity, what we will from here on refer to as mechanosensitivity of the channel. The finding that a site at the membrane interface plays such a crucial physiological role affirms the intimate interactions that membrane-tension-gated channels have with their lipid environment.
PARÁGRAFO: In an attempt to correlate channel kinetics with specific regions of the protein, numerous chimeras of the Eco- and Sa-MscL channel proteins were generated. Figure 1 shows the locations of different domains of the protein imposed upon the crystal structure of the Tb-MscL (panel a) as well as the sequence alignment of the Eco- and Sa-MscL proteins (panel b). The nomenclature of all chimeras tested is as follows: E and S represent regions from Eco- and Sa-MscL protein, respectively, which is followed by numbers showing the locations according to the Eco-MscL registry. As shown in Figure 2, recording the single channel openings of many Eco- and Sa-MscL chimeras revealed a pattern in channel open dwell time. Figure 2A shows chimeras with very short open dwell times, similar to wild type Sa-MscL. Chimeras in this panel share a common sequence in what is essentially the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface of the Sa-MscL, specifically amino acids (aa) 44-49. In contrast to chimeras shown in Figure 2A, channels shown in Figure 2B share a common sequence in the same region which, instead is from Eco-MscL. These chimeras also contain the periplasmic loop and beginning of TM2 from Eco-MscL, thus giving a total Eco-MscL domain of aa 44-77. This common sequence correlates with longer open dwell times, similar to the Eco-MscL activities.
PARÁGRAFO: The nomenclature of all chimeras tested is as following: E and S represent regions from Eco- and Sa-MscL protein, respectively, which is followed by numbers showing the locations according to the Eco-MscL registry. Schematic illustration of each chimera is shown in the left with open boxes and black lines representing domains from E. coli MscL, while filled blue boxes and blue lines showing those from S. aureus MscL. Typical traces, with the appropriate scale bars, are shown at the right of each chimera. Specific areas of the protein that correlate with kinetics are boxed with red boxes highlighting the regions that correlate with long open dwell times and green boxes labeling the regions relevant to short channel kinetics. The chimeras have been grouped as discussed in text. Panel e shows a schematic summary showing the regions identified to be important in channel kinetics.
PARÁGRAFO: The analyses of additional chimeras demonstrated that different subdomains of this entire periplasmic region, aa 44-77, effect different behaviors in channel kinetics. The most dramatic example is seen in Figure 2C, where we found that if a channel contains the TM1 periplasmic region of Eco-MscL, aa 44-49, as well as the periplasmic loop region from Sa-MscL, aa 50-77, a super-long open dwell time channel is produced, thus suggesting that both regions lead to stabilization of the open state; note that the time scale of the two chimeras in this panel is 86-fold and 140-fold of that for chimeras shown in panels a and b, respectively.
PARÁGRAFO: This latter observation allows us to make some predictions. It first suggests that a combination of Sa-MscL “shortening” effects of Sa-MscL 44-49 and Eco-MscL aa 50-77 should yield a channel with “super-short” channel kinetics. While Figure 2A is consistent with this prediction, it cannot be rigorously tested; the equipment used cannot easily resolve channel openings below 1ms, which is approximately the longest opening for the Sa-MscL channel. However, it also predicts that a combination of the “shortening” effects of Sa-MscL aa 44-49 with the “lengthening” effects of Sa-MscL aa 50-77 in an Eco-MscL background would lead to a channel with intermediate kinetics, perhaps not dissimilar to Eco-MscL. Indeed, as seen in Figure 2D, this prediction is upheld. Since aa 50-77 contains both the non-conserved periplasmic loop (aa 50-74) as well as the highly conserved beginning of TM2 (aa 75-77), the different effect of aa 50-77 from Sa- and Eco-MscL is very likely generated by differences in the periplasmic loop (aa 50-74).
PARÁGRAFO: The effects of the periplasmic loop are not easily attributed to a shorter sub-domain. Chimeras containing the end of TM1 (aa 44-49) from Eco-MscL and only the latter part of periplasmic loop region (aa 56-77) from Sa-MscL also show an increase in open dwell times, but not as dramatic as that observed in Figure 2C (in Fig. S1). Hence, the nonconserved periplasmic loop appears to act as a unit in its regulation of channel kinetics.
PARÁGRAFO: While the region of the protein from aa 44-77 appears to play a vital role in defining the kinetics of the channel, any structure/function relationship of conductance and mechanosensitivity appears to be much more complicated. There is no obvious correlation between these periplasmic regions and channel conductance or mechanosensitivity. For example, using an accepted mechanosensitivity gage(Blount et al., 1999; Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998) where MscS is used as an internal standard within the patch, and the ratio of gating threshold pressure for MscL (pL) divided by the threshold pressure of MscS (pS) is determined, we found the pL/pS ratio ranged from 0.85 to 2.5 with wild type Eco-MscL at 1.47 and Sa-MscL at 1.96, and the most sensitive chimera, SES56-77 (ratio 0.85), and one of the least sensitive, ESE44-77 (ratio 2.5), are in the same group shown in Figure 2A. For these chimeras we could find no correlation between either conductance or mechanosensitivity with the channel open dwell times.
PARÁGRAFO: In summary, as shown in Figure 2C, the aa 44-49 region from Eco-MscL and the periplasmic loop from Sa-MscL confer long open dwell times, while aa 44-49 from Sa-MscL and periplasmic loop from Eco-MscL confer short open dwell times. Hence, the combination of Eco-MscL aa 44-49 and Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with extremely long openings, as shown in Figure 2C.
PARÁGRAFO: In contrast to the periplasmic loop, the periplasmic portion of TM1 is small and relatively conserved. Note that the SES44-49 chimera shown in Figure 2C, which has extremely long open dwell times, contains only 5 alternative residues relative to the wild type Sa-MscL channel (G46 is conserved). In order to determine if a specific site within the end of TM1 (aa 44-49) is responsible for controlling open dwell times, we generated site-directed mutations. As shown in Figure 3A, mutations of the Eco-MscL residues within this region were systematically changed back to the Sa-MscL sequence. Changing P44 back to L, PL44-45 to LI, L47 to K and L48 to I had no apparent effect on the aberrantly long channel openings. In contrast, mutation of I49 to F drastically reduced the channel open dwell time. A small, and as of yet unexplained change in conductance was noted: I49F was 3.48±0.04 nS, while the other mutants ranged from 3.80 to 4.05 nS; however, all were much larger than the conductance of Sa-MscL (2.5±0.2 nS), again suggesting that this is not a site of major regulation of channel conductance. On the other hand, the data indicate that residue 49, located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, is an important site for defining channel kinetics.
PARÁGRAFO: A. The Isoleucine at position 49 correlates with the long openings observed for the SES44-49 chimera. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in chimera SES44-49 to re-introduce S. aureus MscL residues, shown as gray dots; E. coli residues are marked as black dots. The traces were normalized to the scale bar in the upper right. “O” and “C” refer to open and closed. B. Exchanging I49 and F47 between E. coli and S. aureus MscL channels changes the channel open dwell time. Mutation of I49 to phenylalanine, a S. aureus MscL equivalent residue, in E. coli MscL generates a channel with short open dwell times. Substitution of F47 with isoleucine, an E. coli equivalent residue, in S. aureus MscL leads to a channel with long open dwell times. At top right of the traces, the scale bars are shown.
PARÁGRAFO: If residue 49 indeed controls the open dwell time, then mutation of this residue within wild type Sa- and Eco-MscL backgrounds should also alter channel kinetics. We therefore exchanged the amino acids at this location. As shown in Figure 3B, mutation of Eco-MscL I49 to the residue of the comparable site of Sa-MscL, F, generates a channel with short open dwell times, similar to the Sa-MscL. Conversely, mutation of the Sa-MscL equivalent site, F47, to the Eco-MscL I leads to a channel with pronounced long open dwell times. Consistent with our findings that the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop defines long open dwell times, isoleucine at this site in the wild type Sa-MscL background leads to much longer channel openings than observed for the wild type Eco-MscL activity. Therefore, the Eco-MscL I49, and the Sa-MscL equivalent site, F47, is important in controlling the open dwell time of wild type MscL channels as well as chimeras. In sum, these data demonstrate that a single amino acid at the periplasmic end of TM1 can have dramatic effects on the stabilization of the open state of the channel.
PARÁGRAFO: In an attempt to determine the possible mechanisms for the role of this site in controlling channel openings, we mutated F47 in Sa- MscL into different amino acids. As shown in Figure 4A, Figure S2 and Table S1, mutations at this site led to channels with varying open dwell times that correlate with the hydrophobicity of the substitutions (r2=0.34, p=0.047). The hydrophobic amino acids I and L effected very long openings while those with charged side chains, K and E, led to shorter openings. However, all three aromatic amino acids anomalously led to very short openings.
PARÁGRAFO: A. Linear regression analysis of hydrophobicity with open dwell time. Kinetic analysis of the open dwell times was fitted to a three-open state model (see Materials and Methods). The longest time constants, τ3, expressed as the mean ± s.e.m, were plotted against the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic score for each amino acid substitute. B. Hysteresis of Sa-F47L mutant. Representative traces show the delay of both opening and closing upon pressure application. The current and pressure recordings are shown in the upper and lower traces, respectively. Below the traces, the open probability (Po) of a typical experiment is plotted against pressure stimulation. Pressure was normalized to the threshold required to open MscS. Data for opening and closing were fit to Boltzmann equation, respectively, y = (ex)/(1 + ex), where x = (p − p1/2)/k, p is the applied pressure, p1/2 is the point at which the Po is 0.5, and k is the slope. Each pressure was held for 0.6 to 4s. Values for Po were obtained by current integration normalized to the total number of channels in the patch. At the highest pressure, the current remained relatively constant toward a maximum value, and no opening events were ever observed to exceed the value defined as Po = 1.0. C. Linear regression analysis of hydrophobicity with mechanosensitivity. pL/pS ratio was plotted against the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic score for each amino acid substitute. D. Linear regression analysis of open dwell time and mechanosensitivity. Open dwell time was plotted against the pL/pS ratio of each amino acid substitute.
PARÁGRAFO: Among all the mutants that effect long open dwell times, F47L had an obvious hysteresis. As shown in Figure 4B, the channel showed a delay of several seconds in both opening and closing upon pressure changes. Boltzmann functions of open probability (Po) versus pressure were quite different for opening (P1/2 = 2.0 of pL/pS) and closing (P1/2 = 0.9 of pL/pS) when the duration of each pressure step is from 0.6 to 4s. The difference of the P1/2 for channel opening and closing was not apparent when slower pressure ramp (> 30s) was applied. Such hysteresis was also noted for the chimeras, SES44-49 and ESE50-77, discussed above, and appears to be an extreme exaggeration of a very mild hysteresis (less than a 10% change between opening and closing P1/2) of the wild type Eco-MscL reported previously (Kamaraju et al., 2010).
PARÁGRAFO: All of the mutations at Sa-F47 caused a decrease in pL/pS ratio reflecting a more sensitive channel, as shown in Figure 4C and Figure S2. Moreover, the pL/pS ratio correlated with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid substitutions (r2=0.4, p=0.027), with hydrophobic amino acids effecting higher pL/pS ratios, and thus reflecting a channel that is less sensitive to membrane tension. In contrast with the kinetic data discussed above, and as shown in Figure 4A, the three “bulky” aromatic amino acids followed this correlation with mechanosensitivity well (Fig. 4C), suggesting a different mechanism underlying how the hydrophobicity of residue 47 affects channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity; in essence, the outliers for the correlation shown in Figure 4A are not seen in 4C. Consistent with this hypothesis, no correlation between open dwell time and pL/pS ratio of all mutations at F47 was observed (Fig. 4D). In summary, the above data confirm that the residue at this location plays a profound role in defining Sa-MscL open dwell times as well as mechanosensation; while hydrophobicity and “bulk” may help to define the channel kinetics, hydrophobicity alone plays the major role in determining mechanosensitivity.
PARÁGRAFO: To test whether the equivalent site, I49, in Eco-MscL also plays an important role in channel function, we selectively mutated I49 to F, Y, and C. Surprisingly, we found that same mutations changed channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity with a similar trend as that observed for Sa-MscL (Fig. 5A and B and Fig. S3). These data suggest that this site has a conserved function among orthologues.
PARÁGRAFO: A. The open dwell time τ3 of Sa-MscL and Eco-MscL are plotted for each of the substitutions. Each point reflects a mean value ± s.e.m. The two Y axes are as labeled. B. Correlation between the hydrophobicity and mechanosensitivity. The pL/pS ratio of both Eco-49 and Sa-47 substitutions are plotted against their Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic scores.
PARÁGRAFO: While several studies on Eco- or Tb-MscL have suggested that the periplasmic region may play a role in MscL channel regulation (Ajouz et al., 2000; Blount et al., 1996b; Jeon and Voth, 2008; Maurer et al., 2000; Maurer and Dougherty, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2005), no one had successfully identified a single sub-domain or residue that acted as a variable spring element, in either a consistent or opposing manner, across bacterial species. In this study, using a chimera approach we were able to identify such subdomains, and ultimately, a single residue.
PARÁGRAFO: We initially found that the periplasmic loop of Eco-MscL confers short channel openings and that of Sa-MscL defines long openings. In contrast, the relatively conserved TM1/periplasmic lipid interface (44–49) influenced channel kinetics in an opposite manner with that from Eco-MscL effecting long open dwell times, and that from Sa-MscL generating short open dwell times. Thus, these two periplasmic regions appear to work in concert within these two orthologues, and the engineered combination of the Eco-MscL TM1/periplasmic lipid interface and the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with a stabilized open state and extremely long open dwell times.
PARÁGRAFO: The further dissection of the TM1/periplasmic loop interface led to the finding that a single residue at the lipid interface, I49 for Eco-MscL and the analogous site F47 for Sa-MscL, has profound effects on channel kinetics, thus suggesting an important role of protein-lipid interactions at this region. Furthermore, we generated one particular mutant by site directed mutagenesis, Sa-MscL F47L, which has an extreme channel phenotype in that it shows a severe hysteresis as well as delay in both opening and closing. These data demonstrate that not only can the energy barrier for gating, or the transition between closed and open states, be modified by a mutation at Sa-F47, but that the transition from closed to open can be drastically different from that for going from open to closed states. A recent molecular dynamic simulation study on Eco-MscL channel gating suggests that, during the gating process, membrane thinning induces a kink within the TM1/periplasmic loop interface, essentially in and around Eco-I49, which causes outward motion of the periplasmic loop away from the pore center (Deplazes et al., 2012). We propose that the easing or resisting of some restraint, such as this proposed kink formation, may modulate the transition between open and closed states, like adjusting the spring on a clasp knife.
PARÁGRAFO: Studying additional channels altered by site-directed mutagenesis, we found consistent correlations between residue properties and their effects on channel function for Sa- as well as Eco-MscL; these data suggest a common functional role for this site between orthologues. As a general rule, hydrophobic residues led to longer open times, although streamlined hydrophobic residues appear to be more efficient in this aspect than those containing bulkier aromatic rings, presumably because of some sort of steric hindrance of the latter. The role of this residue in channel mechanosensation was also studied, and more hydrophobic substitutions were found to decrease mechanosensitivity. Therefore, increasing the hydrophobicity appears to increase the energy barrier required to achieve an open state, but once achieved, the open state is stabilized; increasing the hydrophilicity does the opposite, demonstrating that this spring element is adjusted by hydrophobicity. These findings are reminiscent of early studies suggesting that hydrophobic interactions, coined a “hydrophobic lock”, at the pore constriction keeps the channel closed; according to this theory, it is the exposure of these residues to the aqueous solution that is a major energy barrier for channel opening (Blount et al., 2007; Blount and Moe, 1999; Moe et al., 2000; Yoshimura et al., 1999). Note, however, that the “lock” is due to the bundling of hydrophobic residues from each of the subunits at the constriction of the pore, whereas here we found a residue at the lipid interface where no such bundling of residues is likely to occur.
PARÁGRAFO: Although we found that the hydrophobicity of this spring element at the TM1 periplasmic lipid interface is important in both channel kinetics and mechanosensation, it is important to note that there are differences in the two correlations. For example, aromatic amino acids fit the hydropathy correlation for mechanosensation but not open dwell time. Several studies emphasize the importance of aromatics in potential lipid interactions for MscL (Sawada et al., 2012) as well as other mechanosensitive channels such as TRPY1 and other TRP channels (Su et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007) and belts of aromatics are seen in other membrane proteins, including KcsA (Doyle et al., 1998). Thus, aromatic residue-lipid interactions may play more of a role in mechanosensation than kinetics. We also observed that there is no correlation between mechanosensitivity and open dwell time for the various substitutions. Hence, although the relative hydrophobicity of this spring element effects changes in both kinetics and mechanosensation, it does so by different underlying mechanisms.
PARÁGRAFO: In summary, by initially using a chimera approach, we identified a single amino acid serves as a “clasp knife spring” for the resistance and stability of channel opening and closing. The hydrophobicity and steric shape of this residue, complemented by the periplasmic loop, appears to define channel mechanosensitivity and kinetics in both Sa- and Eco-MscL.
PARÁGRAFO: All chimeras were generated using the PCR ligation method (Blount and Krause, 1993; Innis et al., 1990). All other site-directed mutants were generated using Mega primer method as described previously (Levin and Blount, 2004) and all were inserted in the pB10d expression construct (Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998). The E. coli strain PB104 (ΔmscL:Cm) was used for electrophysiological experiments (Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998). Cultures were grown routinely in Lennox broth (LB) medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburbh, PA, USA) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Expression was induced by addition of 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; Anatrace inc., Maumee, OH, USA).
PARÁGRAFO: As described previously (Blount et al., 1999; Martinac et al., 1987), excised, inside-out patches from E. coli giant spheroplasts were examined at room temperature. Patch buffer contained 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and 5 mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pH 6.0. Data were acquired at −20 mV at a sampling rate of 20 kHz with a 5-kHz filter, using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). For simplicity, the channel openings are shown upwards in the figures. A piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used to monitor the pressure introduced to patch membrane by suction throughout the experiments. Measurements were performed using Clampfit9 from pCLAMP9 (Axon Instruments).
PARÁGRAFO: For the kinetic experiments, the data were fit to a three open state model, as previously performed (Blount et al., 1996a; Blount et al., 1996b; Ou et al., 1998). The two longer time constants (τ2 and τ3) could be easily determined; the shortest is beyond the resolution of the equipment used. All kinetic data were obtained from at least 300 opening events per mutant from three independent experiments performed in at least two independent spheroplast preparations.
PARÁGRAFO: Mechanosensitivity was determined as previously described (Blount et al., 1999; Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998). Briefly, MscS is used as an internal standard within the patch, and the ratio of gating pressure for MscL divided by the threshold pressure of MscS is determined; here we will refer to this as the pL/pS ratio. All mechanosensitivity data were obtained from at least three independent recordings performed in at least two independent spheroplast preparations.
PARÁGRAFO: MscL from E. coli and S. aureus are functionally distinct mechanosensitive channels
PARÁGRAFO: MscL Chimeras allow correlation of structural differences with functional variance
PARÁGRAFO: Residue hydropathy at one site influences gating and state-stabilization of MscL
PARÁGRAFO: One residue can vary MscL activity similar to adjusting a spring of a clasp knife

PARÁGRAFO: Our report (1) describing the discovery of extensive horizontal gene transfer in a tardigrade genome has raised questions from other groups who were sequencing the Hypsibius dujardini genome in parallel or who have done new experiments and analyses since our report (2–5). Bemm et al. (2) now report filtering our data for likely contaminants, resulting in a new, prefiltered genome assembly. Arakawa (3) has sequenced genomes of starved, washed, individual animals that had been treated with antibiotics for 48 h, and used this genomic sequence and RNA-Seq data to identify likely bona fide tardigrade contigs. Two other reports have contributed data and analysis: Delmont and Eren (4) used a newly published analysis and visualization platform, Anvi'o (6), to identify likely contaminants in our genome assembly, and Koutsovoulos et al. (5) applied useful taxon-annotated GC coverage plots (Blobplots) (7) to our data and reported an independent genome assembly.
PARÁGRAFO: Before discussing the robustness of our finding of extensive horizontal gene transfer in tardigrades, we first note that we mistakenly uploaded an outdated version of our assembly to public databases. This assembly was 252 Mb, larger than the 212.3-Mb assembly that we had used in our report (1), as pointed out correctly by others (5). The 212.3-Mb assembly used in our report is available at the link provided below. The originally uploaded 252-Mb assembly includes ∼40 Mb of sequence that we had identified as microbial contamination (see methods detailed at https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response). This mistake may have contributed to discrepancies and issues raised by others. For example, Bemm et al. (2) identified 39 Mb of untrusted assembly, similar to the ∼40 Mb we filtered. Similarly, Delmont and Eren (4) identified whole bacterial genomes in our 252-Mb assembly, which were already largely filtered out in our 212.3-Mb assembly. We apologize to other groups for this mistake.
PARÁGRAFO: A central finding of our original report (1) is a high rate of foreign genes in the H. dujardini genome, which has been argued by others (2–5) to be an artifact of incomplete filtering of contaminating microbial sequences. The availability of these other groups' independent assemblies and multiple filtering approaches [via k-mer selection (2) or GC% and coverage (5)] allows us to test the robustness of our conclusions. Because any metric used will have its own particular strengths and weaknesses, we used three different approaches: (i) employing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) index (8), (ii) identifying genes that align to prokaryotic but not eukaryotic sequences, and (iii) identifying a base level of HGT, i.e., “class C” genes as defined by Crisp et al. (9).
PARÁGRAFO: Using the HGT index, we find that 3.8–7.1% of genes in these independent H. dujardini assemblies appear foreign (Fig. 1A). Examination of genes with prokaryotic but not eukaryotic alignments resulted in the identification of 164–384 genes (Fig. 1B). Class C genes in various H. dujardini assemblies range from 2.5% to 4.6% (Fig. 1C). For each of these metrics, the proportion and/or number of foreign genes found in H. dujardini is substantially elevated compared with typical animals (Fig. 1) (8–11).
PARÁGRAFO: Identification of foreign sequences in independent H. dujardini assemblies by different methods. (A) Foreign genes in independent H. dujardini genome assemblies were identified using the HGT index (8). The percent of all foreign genes in each dataset is shown. Tardigrade data are labeled in blue. Rotifer (animals with high levels of HGT) data are shown in brown. Data for other invertebrates (Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) are labeled in green. Rotifer, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster data were obtained from ref. 8. (B) Foreign genes were identified by selecting only those genes with BLAST hits to prokaryotes, but not eukaryotes (Evalue cutoff 1e-5). Note that this is a significantly more stringent approach for identifying foreign genes than the HGT index, and it excludes identification of prokaryotic genes with metazoan homologs, nonmetazoan eukaryotic genes, or metazoan genes that have been horizontally transferred. The raw number of all foreign genes in each dataset is shown. Tardigrade data are labeled in blue. Rotifer (animals with high levels of HGT) data are shown in brown. Data for other invertebrates (C. elegans and D. melanogaster) are labeled in green. Rotifer and C. elegans data were derived from ref. 8. D. melanogaster data were obtained by performing HGT index analysis (see methods at https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response) and the applying selection criteria detailed above. (C) Class C genes were identified in various datasets using the parameters detailed in ref. 9. Data for chordate and ecdysozoan animals were obtained from ref. 9, and the source of other datasets is noted parenthetically on the x axis. Plotted on the y axis is the percent of total genes that are classified as Class C foreign genes according to the methods used in ref. 9. Data for rotifer species are colored brown. Data from various tardigrade assemblies are colored blue. Data for other ecdysozoan animals (the group of animals to which tardigrades belong) are colored in green. Data for chordate animals are colored purple. The numbers above bars denote the percent of all genes classified as Class C foreign genes.
PARÁGRAFO: In favor of these foreign genes not being contaminants is the fact that, in these independent assemblies, most genes identified as foreign reside on scaffolds together with tardigrade genes. Furthermore, foreign vs. tardigrade genes from these assemblies are represented at similar proportions in the other assemblies. On the whole, these independent assemblies show robust coverage of scaffolds from genomic and RNAseq reads of four independent sequencing efforts [including cleaned, antibiotic-treated individuals (3)] (Fig. 2). If these genes of foreign origin are considered to be contaminants and their scaffolds are removed, the completeness and size of each assembly is severely affected.
PARÁGRAFO: Foreign genes are contained in scaffolds confirmed by multiple datasets. 14 next-generation sequencing read datasets, originating from 4 independent sequencing projects, were mapped against (A) Bemm et al.’s (2) and (B) Koutsovoulos et al.’s (5) assembly and visualized using Anvi’o (6). Tracks showing coverage of Moleculo long-read (LR), Pacbio, and short-insert library reads [University of North Carolina (UNC) 300, 500, and 800] from our original study (1) are colored blue. Tracks showing coverage by genomic reads from ref. 5 are colored purple. Tracks showing coverage by genomic and pooled RNAseq reads generated by Dr. Kazuharu Arakawa are colored green. The track showing coverage by pooled RNAseq reads generated by Dr. Itai Yanai is colored yellow. Black tick marks in the outer rings indicate scaffolds that contain foreign sequences identified using the method indicated in parentheses. Highlighted in red are scaffolds that are covered by genomic reads originating from only one group’s sequencing effort. Highlighted in orange are scaffolds covered by two of three groups’ genomic reads.
PARÁGRAFO: Together, these data suggest that H. dujardini is likely to have an elevated level of foreign genes, most likely acquired by HGT rather than being artifacts of remaining contaminants. The level of HGT that we infer remains higher than in most animals that have been tested (Fig. 1), although not as high a level as we had originally concluded (1).
PARÁGRAFO: It has been suggested that many foreign genes in the H. dujardini genome might not be functional or might be contaminants because RNAseq reads do not map to some of these genes (3, 5). However, it is well documented in the literature that many HGT genes are expressed at low levels or, in some cases, are not expressed at all. For example, it is known that essentially the entire Wolbachia genome has been transferred into the genome of Drosophila ananassae, yet only ∼2% (28/1,206) of these horizontally acquired genes are transcribed at detectable levels (12). Follow-up investigations confirmed extensive HGT into the nuclear genome of this Drosophila species but failed to detect biologically relevant expression of any foreign genes (13, 14). Thus, although identification of an expressed foreign gene could be viewed as evidence in favor of HGT, lack of expression alone is not a criterion for disproving HGT. We speculated that HGT might be important for tardigrade biology, but we restricted our analysis to HGT rather than functional HGT (1). The RNAseq datasets (3, 5) will aid in assessing potential functions of these genes.
PARÁGRAFO: We acknowledge that different groups have concluded different proportions of HGT in the H. dujardini genome and that different metrics will give different estimates for the proportion of foreign genes in the genome. We have our own concerns about some of the methods used by other groups to exclude genes from our assembly (see https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response), but we appreciate that the work of multiple groups is moving the science forward rapidly. All genomes are iterations, and we fully expect that new data and new technologies will refine this genome much as they have for the human genome and others. The true proportion of HGT may well lie between the various current estimates and may best be resolved with new sequencing technologies and bioinformatic and phylogenetic approaches.
PARÁGRAFO: The authors declare no conflict of interest.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Tardigrades, microscopic animals that survive a broad range of environmental stresses, express a unique set of proteins termed tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs). TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation. Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade proteins termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (“SAHS”) proteins, and investigate their ability to protect diverse biological structures. Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins prevent desiccated liposomes from fusion, and enhance desiccation tolerance of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici upon extracellular application. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative structural analysis suggest a model by which SAHS proteins may undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water and solutes from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet structure. These results highlight the potential application of SAHS proteins as stabilizing molecules for preservation of cells.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Anhydrobiosis, a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state, is a remarkable example of survival strategies. This study focuses on anhydrobiosis in tardigrades, which are known for their resilience to severe environmental conditions. Tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation, notably the constitutive expression of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins in Ramazzottius varieornatus. These proteins share similarities in their amphiphatic alpha helices with late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, but differ significantly in their amino acid sequences. In this study, we further explored the functionality of CAHS proteins by analyzing their role in aggregation and tolerance to hyperosmotic stress in mammalian cells. Using live cell imaging, we examined the subcellular localization of several CAHS and LEA proteins in response to hyperosmotic stress. The expression of CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis but also highlight the potential of CAHS proteins as cryoprotectants.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Water unavailability is an abiotic stress causing unfavourable conditions for life. Nevertheless, some animals evolved anhydrobiosis, a strategy allowing for the reversible organism dehydration and suspension of metabolism as a direct response to habitat desiccation. Anhydrobiotic animals undergo biochemical changes synthesizing bioprotectants to help combat desiccation stresses. One stress is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, the eutardigrade Paramacrobiotus spatialis was used to investigate the occurrence of ROS associated with the desiccation process. We observed that the production of ROS significantly increases as a function of time spent in anhydrobiosis and represents a direct demonstration of oxidative stress in tardigrades. The degree of involvement of bioprotectants, including those combating ROS, in the P. spatialis was evaluated by perturbing their gene functions using RNA interference and assessing the successful recovery of animals after desiccation/rehydration. Targeting the glutathione peroxidase gene compromised survival during drying and rehydration, providing evidence for the role of the gene in desiccation tolerance. Targeting genes encoding glutathione reductase and catalase indicated that these molecules play roles during rehydration. Our study also confirms the involvement of aquaporins 3 and 10 during rehydration. Therefore, desiccation tolerance depends on the synergistic action of many different molecules working together.

PARÁGRAFO: We developed a new model of hypodynamic loading to support mice in chronic conditions of partial weight bearing, enabling simulations of reduced gravity environments and related clinical conditions. The novel hardware allows for reduced loading between 10 and 80% of normal body weight on all four limbs and enables characteristic quadrupedal locomotion. Ten-week-old female BALB/cByJ mice were supported for 21 days under Mars-analog suspension (38% weight bearing) and compared with age-matched and jacketed (100% weight bearing) controls. After an initial adaptation, weight gain did not differ between groups, suggesting low levels of animal stress. Relative to age-matched controls, mice exposed to Mars-analog loading had significantly lower muscle mass (−23% gastrocnemius wet mass, P < 0.0001); trabecular and cortical bone morphology (i.e., trabecular bone volume: −24% at the distal femur, and cortical thickness: −11% at the femoral midshaft, both P < 0.001); and biomechanical properties of the femoral midshaft (i.e., −27% ultimate moment, P < 0.001). Bone formation indexes were decreased compared with age-matched full-weight-bearing mice, whereas resorption parameters were largely unchanged. Singly housed, full-weight-bearing controls with forelimb jackets were largely similar to age-matched, group-housed controls, although a few variables differed and warrant further investigation. Altogether, these data provide strong rationale for use of our new model of partial weight bearing to further explore the musculoskeletal response to reduced loading environments.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Although the musculoskeletal system is known to be sensitive to changes in its mechanical environment, the relationship between functional adaptation and below-normal mechanical stimuli is not well defined. We investigated bone and muscle adaptation to a range of reduced loading using the partial weight suspension (PWS) system, in which a two-point harness is used to offload a tunable amount of body weight while maintaining quadrupedal locomotion. Skeletally mature female C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to partial weight bearing at 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 21 days. A hindlimb unloaded (HLU) group was included for comparison in addition to age-matched controls in normal housing. Gait kinematics was measured across the full range of weight bearing, and some minor alterations in gait from PWS were identified. With PWS, bone and muscle changes were generally proportional to the degree of unloading. Specifically, total body and hindlimb bone mineral density, calf muscle mass, trabecular bone volume of the distal femur, and cortical area of the femur midshaft were all linearly related to the degree of unloading. Even a load reduction to 70% of normal weight bearing was associated with significant bone deterioration and muscle atrophy. Weight bearing at 20% did not lead to better bone outcomes than HLU despite less muscle atrophy and presumably greater mechanical stimulus, requiring further investigation. These data confirm that the PWS model is highly effective in applying controllable, reduced, long-term loading that produces predictable, discrete adaptive changes in muscle and bone of the hindlimb.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on the physiology of astronauts, many of which are recapitulated in rodent models. Mouse studies performed on the Space Shuttle showed disruption of lipid metabolism in liver. However, given that these animals were not sacrificed on-orbit and instead returned live to earth, it is unclear if these disruptions were solely induced by space stressors (e.g. microgravity, space radiation) or in part explained by the stress of return to Earth. In this work we analyzed three liver datasets from two different strains of mice (C57BL/6 (Jackson) & BALB/c (Taconic)) flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Notably, these animals were sacrificed on-orbit and exposed to varying spaceflight durations (i.e. 21, 37, and 42 days vs 13 days for the Shuttle mice). Oil Red O (ORO) staining showed abnormal lipid accumulation in all space-flown mice compared to ground controls regardless of strain or exposure duration. Similarly, transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing revealed several pathways that were affected in both strains related to increased lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, lipid and fatty acid processing, lipid catabolic processing, and lipid localization. In addition, key upstream regulators were predicted to be commonly regulated across all conditions including Glucagon (GCG) and Insulin (INS). Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis showed that a number of lipid related proteins were changed in the livers during spaceflight. Taken together, these data indicate that activation of lipotoxic pathways are the result of space stressors alone and this activation occurs in various genetic backgrounds during spaceflight exposures of weeks to months. If similar responses occur in humans, a prolonged change of these pathways may result in the development of liver disease and should be investigated further.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Previous work has shown that the soluble murine BMPR1A–fusion protein (mBMPR1A‐mFc) binds to BMP2 and BMP4 with high affinity, preventing downstream signaling. Further, treatment of intact and ovariectomized mice with mBMPR1A‐mFc leads to increased bone mass, and improved bone microarchitecture and strength, via increased bone formation and reduced resorption. In this study, we tested the effects of mBMPR1A‐mFc on disuse‐induced bone loss caused by 21 days of hindlimb unloading (HLU) via tail suspension versus cage controls (CONs). Adult female C57BL/6J mice (12 weeks old) were assigned to one of four groups (n = 10 each): CON‐VEH; CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc; HLU‐VEH; and HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc. Mice were injected subcutaneously with VEH or mBMPR1A‐mFc (4.5 mg/kg, 2×/week). Leg BMD declined in the HLU‐VEH group (–5.3% ± 1.3%), whereas it was unchanged in HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc (–0.3% ± 0.9%, p < 0.05 versus HLU‐VEH). Leg BMD increased significantly more in CON‐mBMPR1A‐mFc than CON‐VEH (10.2% ± 0.6% versus 4.4% ± 0.8%). In the femur, trabecular, and cortical bone microarchitecture was worse in the HLU‐VEH compared to CON‐VEH mice, whereas mBMPR1A‐mFc treatment for 3 weeks led to greater Tb.BV/TV, Tb.Th, and midshaft Ct.Th in both the HLU and CON groups compared to comparable VEH‐treated counterparts (p < 0.05). HLU‐mBMPR1A‐mFc mice also had 21% greater failure load (p < 0.05) compared to their VEH‐treated counterparts. Dynamic histomorphometry indicated that treatment with mBMPR1A‐mFc led to significantly greater mineralizing surface and mineral apposition rate, resulting in a 3.5‐fold and fivefold higher bone formation rate in the mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated CON and HLU animals versus VEH groups, respectively. mBMPR1A‐mFc‐treated mice had a similar osteoblast surface but significantly lower osteoclast surface than VEH‐treated animals in both the CON and HLU groups. Altogether, these findings suggest that treatment with the soluble BMPR1A fusion protein may be useful for maintenance of skeletal integrity in the setting of disuse‐induced bone loss. © 2017 The Authors JBMR Plus published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Disuse-induced bone loss is seen following spinal cord injury, prolonged bed rest, and exposure to microgravity. We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Introduction: It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR5-ion) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12 months post-radiation.
PARÁGRAFO: Methods: To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8 months post-radiation.
PARÁGRAFO: Results: Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change ≥1.2 and an adjusted p-value of ≤0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis.
PARÁGRAFO: Discussion: These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR5-ion results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The vestibular system receives a permanent influence from gravity and reflexively controls equilibrium. If we assume gravity has remained constant during the species' evolution, will its sensory system adapt to abrupt loss of that force? We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth. Despite the permanence of gravity, the snail responded in a compensatory manner to its loss and readapted once gravity was restored.

PARÁGRAFO: The utricle provides the vestibular reflex pathways with the sensory codes of inertial acceleration of self motion and head orientation with respect to gravity to control balance and equilibrium. Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.
PARÁGRAFO: Utricular otolith of inner ear is a weight-lending structure that serves to enable transduction of inertial acceleration of self-motion and head orientation with respect to gravity to control balance and equilibrium.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Coat protein complex I (COPI) and COPII are required for bidirectional membrane trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. While these core coat machineries and other transport factors are highly conserved across species, high-resolution imaging studies indicate that the organization of the ER–Golgi interface is varied in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of COPII assembly, in some cases to manage distinct cellular cargo, is emerging as one important component in determining this structure. Comparison of the ER–Golgi interface across different systems, particularly mammalian and plant cells, reveals fundamental elements and distinct organization of this interface. A better understanding of how these interfaces are regulated to meet varying cellular secretory demands should provide key insights into the mechanisms that control efficient trafficking of proteins and lipids through the secretory pathway.

PARÁGRAFO: Cells operate a signaling network termed unfolded protein response (UPR) to monitor protein-folding capacity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). IRE1 is an ER transmembrane sensor that activates UPR to maintain ER and cellular function. While mammalian IRE1 promotes cell survive, it can initiate apoptosis via decay of anti-apoptotic microRNAs. Convergent and divergent IRE1 characteristics between plants and animals underscore its significance in cellular homeostasis. This review provides an updated scenario of IRE1 signaling model, discusses emerging IRE1 sensing mechanisms, compares IRE1 features among species, and outlines exciting future directions in UPR research.

PARÁGRAFO: The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling network triggered by overload of protein-folding demand in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a condition termed ER stress. The UPR is critical for growth and development; nonetheless, connections between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes remain largely unknown. Here, we identify a link between the UPR and the phytohormone auxin, a master regulator of plant physiology. We show that ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin sensors and transporters in Arabidopsis thaliana. We also demonstrate that an Arabidopsis mutant of a conserved ER stress sensor IRE1 exhibits defects in the auxin response and levels. These data not only support that the plant IRE1 is required for auxin homeostasis, they also reveal a species-specific feature of IRE1 in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, by establishing that UPR activation is reduced in mutants of ER-localized auxin transporters, including PIN5, we define a long-neglected biological significance of ER-based auxin regulation. We further examine the functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 by showing that an ire1 pin5 triple mutant enhances defects of UPR activation and auxin homeostasis in ire1 or pin5. Our results imply that the plant UPR has evolved a hormone-dependent strategy for coordinating ER function with physiological processes.
PARÁGRAFO: Keywords: ER stress, unfolded protein response, auxin response, IRE1, PIN5, Arabidopsis thaliana
PARÁGRAFO: The UPR adjusts the ER protein folding capacity to cope with the dynamic secretory protein demands in cells (Kozutsumi et al. 1988, Schroder and Kaufman 2005). When the ER protein folding machinery is competent, stress sensors are restrained in the ER by ER-resident chaperones (Bertolotti et al. 2000, Kimata et al. 2003). Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER activates ER stress sensors either by causing them to dissociate from protein chaperones or to associate with unfolded proteins (Bertolotti, et al. 2000, Credle et al. 2005, Gardner and Walter 2011, Kimata et al. 2003). Activated ER stress sensors transmit signals to the nucleus for transcriptional regulation of UPR target genes (Kozutsumi et al. 1988, Schroder and Kaufman 2005). If ER stress is not resolved, the UPR triggers the activation of cell death (Lin et al. 2007). IRE1, the only identified ER stress sensor in yeast, is conserved in multicellular eukaryotes (Cox et al. 1993, Mori et al. 1993). Two IRE1 homologues, AtIRE1A and AtIRE1B, have been proven to be functional ER stress sensors in Arabidopsis (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Nagashima et al. 2011). The activation of IRE1 relies on auto-phosphorylation, conformational modification, and oligomerization. Activated IRE1 splices an intron from the mRNA of a UPR-specific bZIP transcription factor (Cox and Walter 1996). The spliced transcription factor enters the nucleus to control UPR target genes (Cox and Walter 1996).
PARÁGRAFO: The UPR is critical for numerous fundamental cellular processes (Wu and Kaufman 2006). IRE1 alpha knockout mice exhibit embryonic lethality (Iwawaki et al. 2009). Dysregulation of the UPR contributes to the pathology of several significant diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer (Marciniak and Ron 2006). In Arabidopsis, mutations of IRE1 lead to a short primary root phenotype (Chen and Brandizzi 2012). Despite the high significance of the UPR in growth and development in multicellular eukaryotes, the regulatory connections between the UPR and other cellular responses remain unclear.
PARÁGRAFO: Because the hormone auxin has profound roles in most plant developmental processes, nucleus-based auxin signaling and plasma membrane (PM)-based intercellular auxin transport have been intensively studied. Three major classes of auxin signaling regulators exist in the nucleus: TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptors (Dharmasiri et al. 2005, Gray et al. 1999, Kepinski and Leyser 2005), AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors (Gray et al. 2001), and ARF transcription factors (Ulmasov et al. 1997). To initiate the auxin response in the nucleus, TIR1/AFBs and auxin coordinately promote degradation of AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors. Consequently, ARFs are released from repression and activate the transcription of auxin responsive genes (Dharmasiri et al. 2005, Gray, del Pozo et al. 1999, Kepinski and Leyser 2005).
PARÁGRAFO: Directional (polar) transport between cells is another crucial regulatory aspect of the auxin response. The auxin efflux carriers of the PIN family are the principal components of the polar auxin transport machinery (Petrasek et al. 2006, Wisniewska et al. 2006). Based on protein topology and subcellular localization, PINs can be classified into PM- or ER-localized types (Dal Bosco et al. 2012, Ding et al. 2012, Mravec et al. 2009). While PM-based intercellular auxin transport has been considered the most critical point of regulation in the auxin response, it has recently been revealed that ER-based auxin regulation is also important. A putative auxin receptor, ABP1, and several auxin transporters (PIN5, PIN6, PIN8, and PILSs) have been shown to localize to the ER. The requirement of the ER-localized regulators in the auxin response underscores the existence of ER-based auxin biology (Barbez et al. 2012, Dal Bosco et al. 2012, Mravec et al. 2009). Despite accumulating evidence that the ER is crucial for auxin regulation (Friml and Jones 2010), the physiological impact of ER-based auxin signaling is largely unknown.
PARÁGRAFO: As the UPR is critical for growth and development, we sought to identify the regulatory connection between the UPR and other cellular regulatory processes. Given the central roles of auxin in numerous aspects of plant physiology, we hypothesized that the UPR regulates auxin signaling for coordinating secretory activities and physiological responses. Through biochemical, molecular biology, and genetic analyses, we demonstrate a connection between the UPR and auxin biology. Specifically, we show that ER stress negatively influences auxin signaling and that the ER-based auxin homoeostasis is important for UPR activation, supporting that the plant UPR alters auxin signaling to cope with ER stress. On the contrary, by establishing that IRE1 is required for the auxin responses, our work reveals that IRE1 has a specific role in hormonal signaling. The regulatory connections between the UPR and auxin biology revealed here hint that plants have evolved an organism-specific strategy to maintain balance between stress adaption and growth regulation.
PARÁGRAFO: To examine whether ER stress modulates the transcription of auxin regulators, we monitored the expression of four auxin co-receptors: TIR1, AFB1, AFB2, and AFB3 (TIR1/AFBs), under ER stress. The UPR was activated by inhibiting protein N-glycosylation using a classical ER stress inducer termed tunicamycin (Tm). Arabidopsis seedlings were subjected to Tm for various periods of time, as adopted in established protocols (Koizumi et al. 2001, Mishiba et al. 2013, Noh et al. 2002). The transcriptional induction of UPR target genes is a molecular indication of UPR activation. To quantify the UPR activation levels, we monitored the transcription of classical UPR activation indicators, BiP1/2 and PDI6 over a 4-h time course of Tm treatment using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses (Kamauchi et al. 2005). BiP1/2 is an ER chaperone essential for the UPR and a primary UPR target gene. PDI6 encodes protein disulfide isomerase. Similar to BiP proteins, upregulation of PDI6 under ER stress contributes to increasing protein-folding capacity in the ER. RT-qPCR showed that both BiP1/2 and PDI6 were induced more than 2-fold at 0.5 h of Tm treatment and their levels increased over the time course of treatment (Figure S1). Interestingly, we found that there was a 20 to 55% percent reduction in the level of TIR1/AFB transcripts 4 h after Tm treatment in wild-type Col-0 seedlings (Figure 1a). These results imply that ER stress negatively influences auxin signaling by repressing TIR1/AFB transcripts. Since TIR1/AFBs activate the auxin response by promoting degradation of the AUX/IAA transcriptional repressors, we sought to determine whether the ER stress-induced repression of TIR1/AFB transcripts resulted in the stabilization of AUX/IAA proteins. To do so, we conducted western blot analyses using transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing DII-VENUS, a fluorescently tagged auxin-interaction domain (DII) of AUX/IAAs that contains the canonical degron responsible for auxin- and TIR1/AFB-mediated protein degradation (Brunoud et al. 2012). As the stabilization of AUX/IAAs is a downstream response of TIR1/AFB reduction, we examined DII-VENUS protein levels 6 h after Tm treatment. Indeed, immunoblot analyses showed that the protein levels of DII-VENUS increased in wild-type Col-0 roots under ER stress treatment (Figure 1b). Consistent with the western blot analysis results, a confocal microscopy approach revealed that DII-VENUS fluorescence levels, and therefore AUX/IAA protein levels, were consistently greater in roots challenged by the ER stress inducer than in mock-treated ones (Figure 1c). Together these observations support that ER stress leads to an increase in AUX/IAA levels, which is most likely a consequence of protein stabilization resulting from the down-regulation of TIR1/AFBs (Figure 1a).
PARÁGRAFO: (a) RT-qPCR analyses of TIR1, AFB1, AFB2, and AFB3 expression in ten-day-old Col-0 Arabidopsis seedlings after treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM) from three independent biological replicates. P-values were calculated by Student’s two-tailed t test against expression levels at 4 h relative to 0 h: TIR1 (P = 0.00036), AFB1 (P = 0.00041), AFB2 (P = 0.00048), AFB3 (P = 0.00032).
PARÁGRAFO: (b) The levels of DII-VENUS fusion proteins increase upon exposure to ER stress. Ten-day-old DII-VENUS transgenic plants were treated with 5 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6 h. Proteins were extracted from root tissues and the fusion proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP serum (upper panel). Coomassie blue staining gel used as loading control (lower panel).
PARÁGRAFO: (c) Ten-day-old transgenic plants expressing DII-VENUS were treated with 5 μg/ml Tm or DMSO for 6 h. Primary root tips were subjected to confocal microscopy analyses. Scale bars = 50 μm.
PARÁGRAFO: (d) PIN mRNA levels decrease upon exposure to ER stress. RT-qPCR analyses of PIN family transcripts in ten-day-old wild-type Col-0 seedlings during treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h. Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates. P-values were calculated against expression levels at 4 h relative to 0 h: PIN1 (P = 0.00221), PIN2 (P = 0.00316), PIN3 (P = 5.4E-05), PIN4 (P = 4.9E-05), PIN5 (P = 6.4E-05), PIN6 (P = 0.00012), PIN7 (P = 0.00353). The transcriptional level of ETR1, an ER-associated ethylene receptor, was unchanged after treatment with Tm for 0.5, 1, or 4 h.
PARÁGRAFO: Next, we investigated whether ER stress could control the transcription of auxin transporters. Using RT-qPCR analyses, we detected a 30–80% decrease in the mRNA levels of PIN1, PIN2, PIN3, PIN4, PIN5, PIN6, and PIN7 in wild-type Col-0 seedlings during ER stress treatment (Figure 1d). In contrast, the transcriptional levels of an ER-associated ethylene receptor (ETR1), two ER-localized cytokinin receptors (AHK2 and AHK3), three nuclear protein (RAN2, ABH1, and FIB1), and two secretory proteins (VSR1 and SCAMP3) (Ahmed et al. 1997, Chang et al. 1993, Kanneganti et al. 2007, Kierzkowski et al. 2009, Law et al. 2012, Ma et al. 2007, Wulfetange et al. 2011) remained unchanged in ER stress conditions (Figure S2). Thus, we conclude that the Tm-induced decrease in the abundance of TIR1/AFB and PIN transcripts is a specific cellular response. When ER stress was triggered by reduction of disulfide bond formation using dithiotreitol (DTT) treatment, similar down-regulation of TIR1/AFB and PIN transcripts was observed (Figure S3). Overall, these results show that ER stress specifically modulates the auxin response by repressing the transcription of auxin co-receptors and transporters.
PARÁGRAFO: Next, we examined whether either IRE1 or TIR1/AFBs is essential for ER stress-induced down-regulation of auxin regulators. To do so, we performed the same ER stress treatment coupled with RT-qPCR analyses in an atire1a atire1b double mutant and a tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 mutant (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Dharmasiri et al. 2005). In atire1a atire1b, both TIR1/AFB and PIN transcripts were still reduced under ER stress conditions (Figure 2a, b), similar to the decreased TIR1/AFB and PIN transcripts pattern seen in wild-type Col-0 (Figure 1a). The PIN transcripts also decreased under ER stress conditions in tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 mutant backgrounds (Figure 2b). However, with the exception of PIN7, in atire1a atire1b the PIN and TIR1/AFB transcription levels were further slightly reduced compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 2c and S4). In contrast, the reduction of PIN1, PIN2, and PIN4 transcript levels was larger in the tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 mutant compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 2c). These data indicate that down-regulation of PIN transcripts on ER stress is partially and slightly affected by mutations of either IRE1 or TIR1/AFBs. These results further suggest that the IRE1 and TIR1/AFBs play unessential but fine-tuning roles in ER stress-mediated repression of auxin regulators.

PARÁGRAFO: While the UPR is necessary for growth and development, the manner by which the UPR influences other cellular regulatory processes is largely unknown. Mammalian IRE1 controls multiple physiological responses under normal growth conditions. Our findings that auxin signaling is altered under ER stress hint that the UPR participates in the auxin response in plants. Although IRE1 is unessential for ER stress-triggered down-regulation of auxin regulators, we aimed to determine whether IRE1-dependent UPR is required for the auxin response without chemical induction of ER stress. Thus, we performed root inhibition assays to test the sensitivity of exogenous auxin application in atire1a atire1b. To do so, atire1a atire1b and wild-type Col-0 were germinated on medium containing a synthetic auxin analog, 1-naphthaleneacetic-acid (NAA), a naturally occurring auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), or an auxin transport inhibitor, 1-N-Naphthylphthalamic-acid (NPA). Interestingly, we found that atire1a atire1b was significantly less sensitive to exogenously applied NAA, IAA, or NPA than wild-type Col-0 (Figure 3a-c). The findings that atire1a atire1b and wild-type Col-0 displayed comparable root-inhibition responses to three other plant hormone, jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene, indicate that the plant IRE1 has a role specifically in the auxin response, as opposed to general hormones responses or growth regulation (Figure S5). To further confirm that AtIRE1A/AtIRE1B is involved in the auxin response, we investigated the transcriptional activation of auxin-responsive genes in atire1a atire1b upon external application of auxin. RT-qPCR analyses showed that the transcriptional induction of five auxin-responsive genes, IAA3, IAA5, IAA19, IAA20, and GH3.6, was compromised after 2 and 4 h of NAA treatment in atire1a atire1b relative to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 3d and Figure S6a). The lower induction of auxin-responsive genes was repeatedly observed after both 1 and 2 h of IAA treatment (Figure S6b). These data further indicate that atire1a atire1b exhibits an impaired response to exogenously applied auxin. The transcription of BiP1/2 or PDI6 was not significantly altered under IAA or NPA treatment in wild-type Col-0, suggesting that IAA or NPA treatment does not trigger ER stress like Tm treatment (Figure S7). Furthermore, we found that there was a 30% reduction in the free auxin level in roots of ten-day-old atire1a atire1b plants compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figure 3e). While IRE1 is required to maintain the free auxin level without ER stress treatment, the free auxin level remained unaffected within 4 h after Tm treatment (Figure S8). All together, these data support that plant IRE1 is required for auxin response and homeostasis.

PARÁGRAFO: Our observations that auxin signaling is regulated by ER stress led us to test whether auxin homeostasis influences UPR activation. To this end, we examined whether mutations in auxin signaling, polar transport, or biosynthesis affected the induction of UPR target genes. Intriguingly, we found that a mutation in PIN5 or PIN6, two ER-localized auxin transporters, compromised UPR activation under ER stress. Compared to wild type, pin5-5 (Mravec et al. 2009) and pin6-4 (Cazzonelli et al. 2013) exhibited a 30–40% reduction in the level of BiP1/2 and PDI6 transcripts during ER stress treatment (Figure 4a and S9). These data imply that ER-based auxin homeostasis contributes to UPR regulation in plants. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that mutants of other types of ER-localized putative auxin transporters, pils2-2, pils5-2, and pils2-2 pils5-2 (Barbez et al. 2012) exhibited similar defects in UPR activation (Figure 4a and S9). We found that the expression levels of BiP1/2 and PDI6 were comparable among wild-type Col-0 and the auxin mutants without ER stress treatment (Figure S10), supporting that the ER-localized auxin transporters are involved in ER stress-triggered UPR activation. In contrast, we found no significant differences in the induction of UPR target genes in mutants defective in either PM-localized auxin exporters, pin1-1 (pin1), eir1-1 (pin2), pin3-4 (pin3), pin4-3 (pin4), pin7-2 (pin7), pin3-5 pin4-3 pin7-1 (pin3 pin4 pin7), an overexpressor of PIN1 (OxPIN1), or the auxin importer aux1-22 (aux1) compared to wild-type Col-0 under the same ER stress treatment conditions (Okada et al. 1991, Roman et al., 1995, Zádníková et al., 2010, Friml et al. 2002, Friml et al. 2003, Sauer et al. 2006, Swarup et al. 2004) (Figure 4b). These results show that ER-based intracellular auxin transport, but not intercellular auxin transport, is required for the optimal UPR activation in plants.
PARÁGRAFO: (a) RT-qPCR analyses of BiP1/2 and PDI6 in ten-day-old pin5-5 (pin5), pin6-4 (pin6), pils2-2 (pils2), pils5-2 (pils5), pils2-2 pils5-2 (pils2 pils5), abp1-5 (abp1), YUC, and tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 (tir1 afb) relative to wild-type Col-0 Arabidopsis seedlings after a 1-h treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM) from three independent biological replicates. P-values are relative to Col-0: pin5 (P = 0.00029), pin6 (P = 0.00095), pils2 (P = 0.00093), pils5 (P = 0.00067), pils2 pils5 (P = 0.00089), abp1 (P = 0.00215), YUC (P = 0.00014), tir1 afb (P = 0.00026).
PARÁGRAFO: (b) RT-qPCR analyses of BiP1/2 and PDI6 in ten-day-old pin1-1 (pin1), eir1-1 (pin2), pin3-4 (pin3), pin4-3 (pin4), pin7-2 (pin7), pin3-4 pin4-3 pin7-2 (pin3 pin4 pin7), OxPIN1, and aux1-22 (aux1) relative to wild-type Col-0 Arabidopsis seedlings after a 1-h treatment with 5 μg/ml Tm. Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates.
PARÁGRAFO: We next investigated whether the ER-localized putative auxin receptor ABP1 and the auxin biosynthesis enzyme YUC were also involved in the UPR activation. Similar to the auxin mutants defective in ER-based transport, the abp1-5 and YUC (Xu et al. 2010, Zhao et al. 2001) mutants also exhibited reduced levels in the activation of UPR target genes under ER stress (Figure 4a and S9). Conversely, the transcription levels of UPR target genes were higher in the tir1 afb1 afb2 afb3 auxin co-receptor mutant than in wild-type Col-0 (Figure 3a and S9), suggesting that TIR1/AFBs plays a negative role in UPR target gene induction. Altogether, these data highlight that the ER-based regulation of auxin homeostasis may operate as a molecular link between the UPR and other cellular processes.
PARÁGRAFO: To investigate a functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 in the UPR and auxin response, we generated an atire1a atire1b pin5 triple mutant and performed phenotypic analyses. Consistent with previous reports, atire1a atire1b and pin5-5 displayed a short primary root phenotype (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Mravec et al. 2009). We found that the roots of the atire1a atire1b pin5 triple mutant were significantly shorter than those of atire1a atire1b or pin5-5 (Figure 5a). However, atire1a atire1b, pin5-5, and atire1a atire1b pin5 showed comparable lateral root density and hypocotyl length to wild-type Col-0 (Figure S11), suggesting that the IRE1 and PIN5 have a role specifically in regulation of primary root elongation. In addition, atire1a atire1b pin5 also displayed lower free auxin levels compared to atire1a atire1b or pin5-5 (Fig 5b). Specifically, compared to wild-type Col-0, the roots of pin5-5 and atire1a atire1b exhibited a 15 and 30% reduction in free auxin levels, respectively. Nonetheless, the roots of atire1a atire1b pin5 displayed a 45% reduction in free auxin level (Figure 5b). Finally, in agreement with previous findings (Mravec et al. 2009), root inhibition assays showed that pin5-5 was less sensitive than wild-type Col-0 to low concentrations of IAA but displayed a normal response to NAA, NPA, or high concentrations of IAA (Mravec et al. 2009). Intriguingly, the atire1a atire1b pin5 mutant was significantly less sensitive than atire1a atire1b to all three treatments (Figure 5c-e). A comparable root-inhibition response to JA, ABA, and ethylene in atire1a atire1b pin5 indicated that the genetic interaction between IRE1 and PIN5 is specific to the auxin response (Figure S5).

Error bars represent SEM, n > 30. P-values are ire1 pin5 relative to ire1: 50, 100 or 200 nM NAA (P < 0.00032), 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 μM IAA (P < 0.00075), 50 or 100 nM NPA (P < 0.00149). Scale bars = 1 cm.

Error bars represent SEM from three independent biological replicates. P-value is ire1 pin5 relative to ire1: *P = 0.01856.
PARÁGRAFO: We next tested the functional relationship of IRE1 and PIN5 under ER stress. RT-qPCR revealed that the induction of BiP1/2 and PDI6 was also reduced in atire1a atire1b pin5 compared to atire1a atire1b or pin5-5, supporting that PIN5 participates in the UPR activation in a manner not entirely dependent on IRE1. Altogether, our results imply that regulation of ER-based auxin homeostasis is part of ER stress adaptive mechanisms that plants have evolved to parallel the classical UPR signaling pathways.
PARÁGRAFO: Our findings uncover an unpredicted but critical regulatory relationship between two fundamental signaling pathways in plants, the UPR and auxin response. Studies of the mammalian UPR indicate that distinct UPR signaling pathways mediate specific physiological processes (Wu and Kaufman 2006). While the IRE1-dependent mRNA splicing event is the most evolutionarily conserved UPR pathway in eukaryotes, IRE1 has also evolved specific functions in multicellular organisms to associate the UPR with more complex physiological processes (Hetz et al. 2006, Urano et al. 2000). Nevertheless, our understanding of the connection between the UPR and other cellular processes is still in its infancy. Here, we have defined a plant-specific regulatory role for IRE1 in the auxin response. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that IRE1 regulates auxin response independently from the classical UPR, it is plausible that IRE1-dependent UPR signaling is involved in auxin transport. The auxin transport is one of the most crucial regulatory mechanisms in the auxin biology. As most regulatory components of the auxin transport system are secretory proteins, we speculate that the IRE1-dependent UPR signaling maintains a robust and efficient membrane trafficking system for the supply of functional auxin regulators. The identification of auxin regulators directly controlled by IRE1 will elucidate how IRE1 modulates specific aspects of auxin biology to coordinate the secretory pathway with physiological responses. Together with the involvement of UPR-specific membrane tethered transcription factors in brassinosteroid signaling (Che et al. 2010), our results support the significance of the plant UPR in hormone signaling.
PARÁGRAFO: IRE1 regulates the UPR through various mechanisms including unconventional splicing, RNA decay, and protein-protein interaction. It has recently been reported that similar to its mammalian counterpart, plant IRE1 controls gene expression through RNA decay in addition of splicing bZIP60 transcription factor (Mishiba et al. 2013). Mammalian IRE1 operates RNA decay to trigger diverse UPR signaling pathways. It would be interesting to test whether plant IRE1 also relies on its RNA decay function for the auxin response. If IRE1-dependent RNA decay contributes at least partially to the regulation of auxin signaling on ER stress, it would represent a specific regulatory event of the UPR as opposed to random RNA decay under stress. Notably, we have established that IRE1 is required for the optimal auxin response under exogenously applied auxin (Figure 3 and 6a), but plays only partial role in ER stress-induced down-regulation of auxin regulators (Figure 2). These findings support that distinct mechanisms regulate auxin signaling under various conditions to achieve context-specific auxin responses.
PARÁGRAFO: (a) IRE1 is required for the auxin responses upon external auxin application. IRE1, ER- and PM-localized PINs are involved in the maintenance of auxin homeostasis without chemical induction of ER stress.
PARÁGRAFO: (b) ER stress triggers down-regulation of auxin receptors TIR1/AFBs, ER- and PM-localized PINs. IRE1 and ER-localized PINs are required for the optimal induction of UPR target genes.
PARÁGRAFO: We have established that only ER-localized auxin transporters, but not PM-localized auxin exporters or importers, are required for the optimal UPR activation (Figure 6b). Studies of ER-localized auxin regulators suggest that a distinct auxin signaling pathway exists in the ER (Friml and Jones 2010). Accordingly, we propose that ER-based auxin signaling actively transports free auxin through the ER membranes to modulate the signaling response in the nucleus. More specifically, plant cells can transmit signals between sub-cellular compartments by adjusting the free auxin level in the ER, cytosol, and nucleus. We thus propose a previously uncharacterized cellular function for auxin as a signaling molecule that connects subcellular compartments and maintains cellular homeostasis in plants. It has long been believed that intercellular polar auxin transport is the key regulatory component of the auxin response; however, the biological significance of intracellular auxin transport has been overlooked. Our findings support a specific cellular function of ER-based intracellular auxin distribution in the UPR activation, and thus emphasize the importance of ER auxin biology in plant physiology.
PARÁGRAFO: We have shown that ER-localized auxin transporters have a role in the UPR activation. A plausible hypothesis to explain this is that the auxin levels in the ER lumen contribute to UPR activation on ER stress. Namely, ER-localized auxin transporters or their associated proteins might sense ER stress and rapidly adjust auxin levels in the ER lumen. The consequent fluctuation of auxin levels in the ER could in turn affect the magnitude of UPR activation. Nevertheless, because a mutation of PIN5 enhances the atire1a atire1b mutant phenotype in the UPR activation (Figure 5f), PIN5-dependent regulation of auxin levels under ER stress does not completely rely on IRE1. Whether ER-localized auxin transporters can directly monitor ER stress or indirectly sense ER stress-related cellular homeostasis is yet to be established; however, the findings presented here support that ER-localized transporters play a role in the UPR activation. Once a reliable system to monitor auxin levels in the ER lumen is developed, it will be interesting to experimentally confirm that ER-localized transporters mediate auxin transport between ER lumen and cytosol on ER stress.
PARÁGRAFO: PIN5 has been proposed to play a unique role in the auxin response since its transcriptional regulation and regulatory mechanisms appear to be different from PM-localized PINs. It was reported that the transcription of PIN5 is decreased under exogenous application of auxin although PIN5 is required for the auxin response (Mravec et al. 2009). Likewise, our study also showed that ER stress induces a decrease in the transcription of PIN5 while PIN5 is required for the optimal induction of UPR activation. As the PIN5 protein levels have not been monitored under auxin or ER stress treatment, one possibility is that the down-regulation of PIN5 transcript represents a feedback regulatory mechanism. Namely, the cellular availability or the activity of PIN5 may be increased in response to ER stress (e.g. by protein stabilization events or post-translational modifications). This in turn may cause reduction of PIN5 transcriptional levels to safeguard cellular auxin homeostasis. Another possibility is that ER stress represses general auxin responses including inter- and intra-cellular auxin transport to optimize cellular responses to cope with stress. Thus, both PM- and ER-localized transporter are down-regulated under ER stress; however, a basal level of ER-localized transporters may be still required for optimal induction of UPR target gene as they might be involved in stress signal transmission through transport the auxin between subcellular compartments. Thus, mutants of ER-localized auxin regulators would display a compromised UPR activation. Further experimental evidences are needed to verify the possibilities. Nonetheless, our data support that regulation of PIN5 transcripts is a mechanism to maintain PIN5-related cellular homeostasis. Also, pin5-5 was shown to have a higher free auxin levels (Mravec et al. 2009) but we found that pin5-5 displayed lower free auxin level. This is possibly because unlike Mravec et al, which used intact seedlings, we used only root tissues in the free auxin level assay. Future comprehensive quantification analyses of free auxin levels in various tissues will likely reveal whether PIN5 regulates auxin distribution among tissues.
PARÁGRAFO: The molecular mechanisms underlying transcriptional down-regulation of auxin receptors and transporters on ER stress are still unknown. Whether UPR regulators can directly control transcription of auxin receptors and transporters or ER stress-dependent cellular responses mediate auxin homeostasis in a manner independent of classical UPR regulation awaits further validation.
PARÁGRAFO: In contrast to animals, plants, as sessile organisms, have an extraordinary plasticity in post-embryonic development, responding to both internal and external cues. Nonetheless, our understanding of how plants integrate developmental and environmental signals to balance growth and adaptive regulation is limited. The inter-regulation between the UPR and auxin response demonstrated in this study opens a new area of investigation in plant physiology. Given the essential roles of the UPR in multiple stresses adaptation, the integrated action of the UPR and auxin response highlights a plant-specific strategy that evolved to maintain the crucial balance between stress response and growth regulation for ultimate fitness.
PARÁGRAFO: Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) plants were used. Surface-sterilized seeds were plated directly onto petri dishes containing half-strength Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) medium, 1.5% w/v sucrose, and 0.4% Phytagel (Sigma). For normal growth conditions, plants were grown at 21°C under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle.
PARÁGRAFO: Seeds were germinated and grown on half-strength LS medium for 10 days, and then transferred to half-strength LS medium containing 5 μg/ml Tm (Sigma) for the indicated periods of time.
PARÁGRAFO: Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNase I (Qiagen). All samples within an experiment were reverse-transcribed simultaneously using SuperScript® VILO™ Master Mix, (Invitrogen). A no-RT reaction, in which RNA was subjected to the same conditions of cDNA synthesis but without reverse transcriptase, was included as a negative control in all real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays. RT-qPCR with SYBR Green detection using a relative standard curve method was performed in triplicate using the Applied Biosystem 7500 Fast Real-Time 7500 PCR system. Data were analyzed by the summary of efficiency (DDCT) method. The values presented are the mean of three independent biological replicates. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
PARÁGRAFO: Root length and hypocotyl elongation measurements were averaged from 30 plants for each genotype. Data were analyzed by Student’s two-tailed t-test, assuming equal variance; differences with a P-value < 0.05 were considered significant.
PARÁGRAFO: Fifty milligrams of fresh root tissues was ground in plastic tubes with plastic pestles using liquid nitrogen and 500 ml of SDS-containing extraction buffer (60 mM Tris-HCL (pH 8.8), 2% SDS, 2.5% glycerol, 0.13 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), and 1X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Complete (Roche)). The tissue lysates were vortexed for 30 s, heated at 70°C for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged at 13,000 g twice for 5 minutes at room temperature. The supernatants were transferred to new tubes. For SDS-PAGE analysis, 5 ml of the extract in 1x NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) was separated on 4–12% NuPage gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF (polyvinyl difluoride) membrane. The membrane was incubated with 3% BSA in 1x TBST (50 mM Tris-base, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) overnight at 4°C, and was probed with antibody (α-GFP, 1:20,000; Abcam) diluted in the blocking buffer (1:20,000) at room temperature for 1 h. The probed membrane was washed three times with 1x TBST for 5 min and then incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG for α-GFP, 1:20,000; Abcam) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was further washed four times with 1x TBST for 10 min before the signals were visualized with SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology). To visualize YFP fluorescence, an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope Zeiss LSM510 was used to detect the DII expression.
PARÁGRAFO: Approximately 20 roots were cut from ten-day-old seedlings and trasferred into an Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of methanol. Internal standard of [2H5] IAA was added to the sample at amount of 100 fmol per root.

PARÁGRAFO: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a very versatile organelle. Besides its major role as the gateway to the secretory pathway the ER is central to adaptation against abiotic and biotic stress. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on ER dynamics and architecture, the association and interaction of the ER with other organelles as well as its role in stress translation and adaptation (Figure 1).

(2014), When supply does not meet demand-ER stress and plant programmed cell death, (11) Cai et al. (2014), Endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced PCD and caspase-like activities involved.
PARÁGRAFO: The ER is a dynamic network of membrane tubules and sheets. Movement of the ER along the actin cytoskeleton has a significant influence on both its architecture and dynamics. Members of class XI myosin motor proteins have recently been shown to control the movement of the ER and other organelles such as Golgi bodies, peroxisomes and mitochondria. Griffing et al. (2014) explore a subset of class XI myosins with a focus on their role in regulating ER network remodeling by affecting ER tubulation, sheet formation and the persistence of these structures. In addition to the importance of these ER network dynamics for organelle communication, the ER may further directly provide the source membrane for vacuole biogenesis, as hypothesized by Viotti (2014). The majority of soluble vacuolar proteins travel from the ER to the Golgi complex. A growing number of reports however indicate that some proteins, including some vacuolar membrane proteins appear to reach the vacuole without visiting intermediate compartments of the endomembrane system.
PARÁGRAFO: An essential function of the ER is the synthesis of secreted proteins. To insure that only correctly folded proteins are exported from the ER, eukaryotes have evolved ER quality control (ERQC) mechanisms, which supervise the folding process. Protein folding is monitored through the stepwise modification of oligosaccharide side chains on glycoproteins, and proteins that fail to fold correctly are extracted from the folding process and subjected to ER associated degradation (ERAD). Li and Liu (2014) describe the protein folding process and how client proteins are chosen for ERAD. Proper function of the ER is particular relevant under stress where the demand for secreted proteins exceed the ER working load capacity. Under such conditions, ER homeostasis requires cellular communication between the ER and the nucleus. Therefore, eukaryotes have signaling proteins on the ER membrane that sense impaired ER function (ER stress) through the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and that employ different strategies to signal the nucleus. Some of these communication strategies are common to all eukaryotes, while others are unique to plants. Ruberti and Brandizzi (2014) compare the ER stress signal pathways between yeast, plants and animals and review the responses in plants, which vary from adaptive measures to cell death. The bZIP transcription factor bZIP28 represents an ER stress signaling factor that is tethered to the ER membrane under unstressed conditions but is mobilized and transferred to the nucleus upon stress. Srivastava et al. (2014) describe the structure of bZIP28 and underlying principles of bZIP28 mobilization in response to stress.
PARÁGRAFO: ER stress activates the unfolded proteins response (UPR) and the ERAD system to eliminate misfolded proteins, which is vital for the establishment of an effective immune system. Tintor and Saijo (2014) introduce the significance of the ERQC in the synthesis of immune receptors and provide further insights into the causalities of ER function (UPR) and plant immunity. Despite its role in immunity, the ER has been hijacked by viruses to promote viral pathogenesis. As reviewed by Verchot (2014), viruses have developed sophisticated strategies to overload the ER protein folding machinery with viral encoded proteins in infected cells. Interestingly, this activates the UPR and up-regulates cellular chaperones that further aid in virus protein folding. The overall significance of the ER in stress adaption is however apparent and underlined by the review of Nakano et al. (2014) which, in addition to the biogenesis and evolution, discusses the putative function of ER bodies in abiotic and biotic stress. As ER-derived compartments ER bodies contain stress-associated proteins (e.g., various β-glucosidases of the PYK10 family) that are thought to enhance stress resilience by activating glucosinolates and glucosylated phytohormones. The study of Höwing et al. (2014) further identified an immune-active function of the ER-localized cysteine endopeptidase AtCEP1. In addition to its function in developmental processes, AtCEP1 is expressed and localized to the ER network, which condenses around haustoria during powdery mildew infection. Knockout of AtCEP1 results in enhanced susceptibility, suggesting that AtCEP1 is involved in restricting fungal infection, possibly by controlling a defense-related programmed cell death (PCD) at the late stages of the interaction.
PARÁGRAFO: Cells mount adaptive responses (e.g., UPR) to mitigate the damage caused by ER stress. However, when stress becomes so excessive that the ERQC system cannot meet the demands, then PCD ensues. Williams et al. (2014) review the possible links between the UPR and PCD and discuss the involvement of calcium signaling and N-rich proteins in promoting PCD and the role of ER chaperones in limiting it as well as the connection of pathogens to ER-mediated cell death. Cai et al. (2014) finally compare the activation and/or regulation of ER stress-induced PCD in animals and plants and highlight the significance of caspase and caspase-like activities in underlying PCD processes.
PARÁGRAFO: The articles published in this e-book summarize our current knowledge of the multi-functionality of the ER in stress adaptation. By providing a stable microenvironment for the synthesis of metabolites and secreted proteins, the ER functions as an intracellular stress sensory organelle and, accordingly, initiates and regulates adaptive responses to environmental stress. Understanding the molecular basis of these processes and the role of ER architectural dynamics therein is of high relevance for sustainable crop production. We hope our e-book will stimulate research in the field to further enhance our knowledge of ER biology in plants.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. Many of these plants synthesize xyloglucan that contains galactose in two different side chains (L and F), which exist in distinct molecular environments. However, little is known about the contribution of these side chains to xyloglucan function. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants devoid of the F side chain galactosyltransferase MURUS3 (MUR3) form xyloglucan that lacks F side chains and contains much less galactosylated xylose than its wild-type counterpart. The galactose-depleted xyloglucan is dysfunctional, as it leads to mutants that are dwarfed with curled rosette leaves, short petioles, and short inflorescence stems. Moreover, cell wall matrix polysaccharides, including xyloglucan and pectin, are not properly secreted and instead accumulate within intracellular aggregates. Near-normal growth is restored by generating mur3 mutants that produce no detectable amounts of xyloglucan. Thus, cellular processes are affected more by the presence of the dysfunctional xyloglucan than by eliminating xyloglucan altogether. To identify structural features responsible for xyloglucan dysfunction, xyloglucan structure was modified in situ by generating mur3 mutants that lack specific xyloglucan xylosyltransferases (XXTs) or that overexpress the XYLOGLUCAN L-SIDE CHAIN GALACTOSYLTRANSFERASE2 (XLT2) gene. Normal growth was restored in the mur3-3 mutant overexpressing XLT2 and in mur3-3 xxt double mutants when the dysfunctional xyloglucan was modified by doubling the amounts of galactosylated side chains. Our study assigns a role for galactosylation in normal xyloglucan function and demonstrates that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs diverse cellular and physiological processes.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: To overcome endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ER-localized stress sensors actuate distinct downstream organelle-nucleus signaling pathways to invoke a cytoprotective response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to yeast and metazoans, plant UPR studies are more recent but nevertheless fascinating. Here we discuss recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlight conserved and unique features of the plant UPR as well as critical yet-open questions whose answers will likely make significant contributions to the understanding plant ER stress management.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the gateway to the secretory pathway in all eukaryotic cells. Its products subsequently pass through the Golgi apparatus on the way to the cell surface (true secretion) or to the lytic compartment of the cell (vacuolar protein transport). In animal cells, the Golgi apparatus is present as a stationary larger order complex near the nucleus, and transport between the cortical ER and the Golgi complex occurs via an intermediate compartment which is transported on microtubules. By contrast, higher plant cells have discrete mobile Golgi stacks that move along the cortical ER, and the intermediate compartment is absent. Although many of the major molecular players involved in ER-Golgi trafficking in mammalian and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells have homologs in higher plants, the narrow interface (less than 500 nm) between the Golgi and the ER, together with the motility factor, makes the identification of the transport vectors responsible for bidirectional traffic between these two organelles much more difficult. Over the years, a controversy has arisen over the two major possibilities by which transfer can occur: through vesicles or direct tubular connections. In this article, four leading plant cell biologists attempted to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, their opinions are so divergent and often opposing that it was not possible to reach a consensus. Thus, we decided to let each tell his or her version individually. The review begins with an article by Federica Brandizzi that provides the necessary molecular background on coat protein complexes in relation to the so-called secretory units model for ER-Golgi transport in highly vacuolated plant cells. The second article, written by Chris Hawes, presents the evidence in favor of tubules. It is followed by an article from David Robinson defending the classical notion that transport occurs via vesicles. The last article, by Akihiko Nakano, introduces the reader to possible alternatives to vesicles or tubules, which are now emerging as a result of exciting new developments in high-resolution light microscopy in yeast.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Photosynthesis occurs in mesophyll cells of specialized organs such as leaves. The rigid cell wall encapsulating photosynthetic cells controls the expansion and distribution of cells within photosynthetic tissues. The relationship between photosynthesis and plant growth is affected by leaf area. However, the underlying genetic mechanisms affecting carbon partitioning to different aspects of leaf growth are not known. To fill this gap, we analyzed Arabidopsis plants with altered levels of pectin methylesterification, which is known to modulate cell wall plasticity and plant growth. Pectin methylesterification levels were varied through manipulation of cotton Golgi-related (CGR) 2 or 3 genes encoding two functionally redundant pectin methyltransferases. Increased levels of methylesterification in a line over-expressing CGR2 (CGR2OX) resulted in highly expanded leaves with enhanced intercellular air spaces; reduced methylesterification in a mutant lacking both CGR-genes 2 and 3 (cgr2/3) resulted in thin but dense leaf mesophyll that limited CO2 diffusion to chloroplasts. Leaf, root, and plant dry weight were enhanced in CGR2OX but decreased in cgr2/3. Differences in growth between wild type and the CGR-mutants can be explained by carbon partitioning but not by variations in area-based photosynthesis. Therefore, photosynthesis drives growth through alterations in carbon partitioning to new leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area; however, CGR-mediated pectin methylesterification acts as a primary factor in this relationship through modulation of the expansion and positioning of the cells in leaves, which in turn drive carbon partitioning by generating dynamic carbon demands in leaf area growth and leaf mass per unit leaf area.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Eukaryotic cells require mechanisms to establish the proportion of cellular volume devoted to particular organelles. These mechanisms are poorly understood. From a screen for plastid-to-nucleus signaling mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana, we cloned a mutant allele of a gene that encodes a protein of unknown function that is homologous to two other Arabidopsis genes of unknown function and to FRIENDLY, which was previously shown to promote the normal distribution of mitochondria in Arabidopsis. In contrast to FRIENDLY, these three homologs of FRIENDLY are found only in photosynthetic organisms. Based on these data, we proposed that FRIENDLY expanded into a small gene family to help regulate the energy metabolism of cells that contain both mitochondria and chloroplasts. Indeed, we found that knocking out these genes caused a number of chloroplast phenotypes, including a reduction in the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts to 50% of wild type. Thus, we refer to these genes as REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC). The size of the chloroplast compartment was reduced most in rec1 mutants. The REC1 protein accumulated in the cytosol and the nucleus. REC1 was excluded from the nucleus when plants were treated with amitrole, which inhibits cell expansion and chloroplast function. We conclude that REC1 is an extraplastidic protein that helps to establish the size of the chloroplast compartment, and that signals derived from cell expansion or chloroplasts may regulate REC1.

PARÁGRAFO: Much like a factory, the endoplasmic reticulum assembles simple cellular building blocks into complex molecular machines known as proteins. In order to protect the delicate protein folding process and ensure the proper cellular delivery of protein products under environmental stresses, eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. As such, plants make special use of the UPR, and evidence indicates that the master regulators and downstream effectors of the UPR have distinct roles in mediating cellular processes that affect organism growth and development as well as stress responses. In this review we outline recent developments in this field that support a strong relevance of the UPR to many areas of plant life.
PARÁGRAFO: Keywords: Unfolded protein response, ER stress, IRE1, bZIP60, bZIP28, Arabidopsis thaliana
PARÁGRAFO: As the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the entry point to secretory pathway (Vitale and Denecke 1999), the primary site of phospholipid synthesis (Ohlrogge and Browse 1995), a hub for critical stress and growth signaling molecules (Light et al. 2016, Ron and Walter 2007, Shore et al. 2011), and the assembly plant for a third of a cell's total proteome (Wallin and Heijne 1998), interruptions in its functions can have vast consequences in cellular health. Under physiological conditions of growth, a dedicated battery of ER-resident proteins can prevent misfolding of nascent polypeptides and facilitate acquisition of the proper tertiary structure through post-translational modification (e.g., covalent addition of oligosaccharide chains or catalysis of disulfide bond formation) (Dobson 2003, Gupta and Tuteja 2011). In plants affected by environmental stress (e.g. heat stress (Gidalevitz et al. 2011)), proper folding of secretory proteins can be impaired and misfolded proteins can accumulate in the ER igniting a potentially lethal condition known as ER stress (Dobson 2003, Hartl and Haver-Hartl 2009, Buchberger et al 2010). Indeed, under prolonged or severe levels of stress, the accumulation and aggregation of unfolded proteins can become cytotoxic and lead to death of the plant cell in a manner akin to the effect of misfolded proteins that aggregate and cause human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (Hoozemans et al. 2005). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a set of signaling mechanisms designed to prevent accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. Specialized ER-localized membrane proteins are able to detect the buildup of unfolded proteins and activate signaling cascades that modulate the abundance of the proteins dedicated to the folding of nascent polypeptides within the ER to maintain homeostasis (Ron and Walter 2007, Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014, Ruberti et al. 2015). In metazoans the ER-localized stress sensor array consists of the Inositol Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1), Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) and Protein kinase R-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) (Harding et al. 1999, Shen et al. 2002, Wang et al. 1998). In plants, the functional homologs of IRE1 and ATF6 (termed IRE1a, IRE1b and bZIP28 in Arabidopsis thaliana) have been identified to date (Iwata and Koizumi 2012). In yeast, only the IRE1-dependent UPR pathway has been identified (Ron and Walter 2007, Mori 2009). A number of comparative reviews have highlighted the similarities between UPR components shared among plants, metazoans and yeast, and should be referred to for greater contexts on the depth of gene conservation shared by all eukaryotes in regards to UPR-related mechanisms (Chen and Brandizzi 2013, Liu and Howell 2016, Ruberti and Brandizzi 2014, Ruberti et al. 2015).
PARÁGRAFO: The study of the UPR in human and animal models largely centers on genetic defects that allow the buildup of misfolded proteins, and mitigating the cytotoxic effects of the resulting aggregates (Rao and Bredesen 2004, Stefani and Dobson 2003). In plants, UPR research also focuses on improving crop yield under adverse environmental conditions. There is a large potential for biotechnological applications for UPR-related mechanisms in ensuring plant productivity. However, considerable work must be done to understand how the UPR is integrated into intra and intercellular signaling mechanisms that are plant specific. Even though there is considerable evidence to suggest that the UPR components are required for many different aspects of plant physiology, from seed germination to meristematic maintenance (Barba-Espín et al. 2014, Chen and Brandizzi 2012,Chen et al. 2014, Deng et al. 2013, Klein et al. 2006, Deng et al. 2016, Meng et al. 2016), we are only beginning to connect the molecular activities of IRE1 and bZIP28 to the modulation of organism growth and development.
PARÁGRAFO: In this review, we provide a summary of causative ER stress conditions followed by an examination of UPR signaling pathways through a discussion of recent advancements in the field. Given space constraints, this review focuses mainly on UPR studies in the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. Throughout, we draw attention of the reader to new developments in the context of plant growth, development, and metabolic functioning. This is done in an attempt to move beyond a classical linear signal transduction paradigm, and visualize the plant UPR as a network that incorporates energy availability, plant production needs, and environmental conditions into a cohesive output governing plant life.
PARÁGRAFO: If the plant cell was reimagined as a city, it would be easy to see how the ER could be described as the town's central factory. At the ER, shipments of raw materials in the form of amino acids and carbohydrates are reshaped and assembled into fully-functional molecular machines in the form of proteins. Properly folded proteins are then shipped out and utilized for a variety of different purposes in different places throughout or outside the cell. In order to prevent the production of faulty goods, the ER has specific machinery, collectively called ER quality control (ERQC), to survey the protein folding status, facilitate folding and ensure quality of the produced protein. The production of most secretory proteins begins with the co-translational introduction of the protein into the ER. In this process, specific peptide sequences target nascent polypeptide chains to the ER and are translocated across the membrane as they are synthesized via the Sec translocon, which is largely conserved between yeast and plants (Akopian et al. 2013, Denecke et al. 1992, Deneke et al. 1993, Schweiger and Schenkert 2013). As the polypeptide enters the ER lumen, molecular chaperones such as the luminal binding proteins (BiPs), bind to the chain of the nascent polypeptides and prevent premature folding (Carvalho et al. 2014, Foresti et al. 2003). The oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex (Lerouxel et al. 2005) recognizes specific amino acid sequences and transfers N-linked glycans to the peptides. In some cases, this post translational modification adds to the intrinsic stability or solubility of a protein, and importantly, it functions as a recognition beacon for major ER luminal foldase complexes (Sinclair and Elliott 2005). Nascent polypeptides undergo iterative folding cycles where they are passed between the calnexin/calreticulin complex, and UDP-glucose glycoprotein-glucosyltransferase (UGGT), which monitor protein folding and retains unfolded proteins in the ER (Totani et al., 2009) as a part of the ERQC. Other proteins participate in folding cycles under the purview of these central ER foldase complexes, such as thioredoxins (e.g protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs)), which catalyze the reduction and reformation of disulfide bonds (Bottomley et al. 2001, Wilkinson and Gilbert 2004). Properly folded proteins are then transported to the Golgi apparatus, while the unfolded or irremediably misfolded proteins are picked up by proteins like OS9 of the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) system, dislocated out of the ER, ubiquitinated, and finally degraded by the 26S proteasome (Huttner et al. 2012). The process is conserved across eukaryotes and, for example, it mediates the proper folding of critical client plasma membrane receptor proteins in plants, including the Arabidopsis elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) receptor which mediates pathogen associated molecular pattern based immunity (Li et al. 2009) and brassinosteroid insensitive 1 (BRI1) receptor (Li and Chory 1997).
PARÁGRAFO: Although not directly related to the activation of the UPR, the essential physiological relevance of these folding processes, which are monitored by the UPR regulators (via unfolded protein accumulation), are continuously being demonstrated. Beyond enabling proper function of cellular signaling pathways with receptors at the plasma membrane (like EF-Tu and BRI1), the specificity of N-linked glycosylation-bearing proteins has recently been shown to play important roles in regulating cell death. The Arabidopsis BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1) and SERK4 (somatic embryo receptor kinase 4) both interact with immune receptors and BRI1 and negatively regulate hypersensitive response-like programmed cell death (PCD) through yet-unknown mechanisms (Gou et al. 2012, Li et al. 2002, Nam and Li 2002, Roux et al. 2011). Intriguingly, loss of STT3a (staurosporin and temperature sensitive 3), one of the two catalytic subunits of the OST complex involved in N-glycosylation of ER proteins, is linked to the cell death phenotype observed in BAK1/SERK4 silenced plants (de Oliveira et al. 2016). However, UPR deficient mutants did not respond differently to BAK1/SERK1 silencing, which led to the conclusion that UPR regulators IRE1a, IRE1b and bZIP28 may not modulate this specific type of PCD (de Oliveira et al. 2016).
PARÁGRAFO: When examined under salt stress conditions, a stt3a knockout line showed UPR activation and halted cell cycle progression in a similar manner to that described in yeast and mammalian cells after being subjected to ER stress-inducing conditions (Arnold and Tanner 1982, Brewer et al. 1999, Koiwa et al. 2003). This may suggest a possible antagonistic role between STT3a and the UPR components, or may simply indicate that the proteins needed to adapt to salt stress may be glycosylated in order to fold or function properly. In both cases, although the UPR may not directly regulate the expression of BAK1/SERK4 or N-glycosylated salt protective genes, these examples underscore the importance of maintaining the ER as a fully-functional protein folding factory so a plant may adapt to various sources of stresses.
PARÁGRAFO: Enhancing the UPR appears potentially critical to efforts to maintain crop productivity by priming plants to survive under adverse environmental conditions (Valente et al. 2009, Carvalho et al. 2014, Luan et al. 2016 Xiang et al. 2016). One of the most thoroughly described environmental UPR inducer is heat stress (Deng et al. 2011, Duke and Doehlert 1996, Gao et al. 2008, Schmollinger et al. 2013, Yang et al. 2009). More conveniently than heat conditions in the lab, chemical UPR inducers such as tunicamycin, which inhibits the N-linked glycosylation in the ER lumen, are often used to investigate the UPR in many eukaryotic model organisms by mimicking the conditions associated with environmental stresses that cause the buildup of unfolded proteins. Extreme osmotic stress and heavy metals such as selenium have also shown to induce the UPR (Liu et al. 2007, Van Hoewyk 2016). The UPR also plays a role in response to pathogens and other biotic stresses (Moreno et al. 2012, Prasch and Sonnewald 2013, Zhang et al. 2015). Through an unknown mechanism, treatment of Arabidopsis plants with the biotic stress-hormone salicylic acid (SA) was shown to activate both arms of the UPR controlled by IRE1 and bZIP28 (Moreno et al. 2012, Nagashima et al. 2014). This SA-induced UPR activation was also given context by Meng et al. (2016), which showed that the SA-accumulating cpr5 (Constitutive Expression of PR genes 5) mutant is dependent on the UPR to suppress growth. Other studies have demonstrated the interesting effect of organelle sourced reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g. plastids and mitochondria) on the induction of the UPR (Ozgur et al. 2015) suggesting a possible functional connection between the UPR and non-secretory organelles. It was demonstrated that plastid-originated ROS production induced UPR activation suggesting that plastidial stress may be intimately linked with, and responded to, through the ER stress signal transduction mechanisms (Ozgur et al. 2015). Given the close connections between SA and ROS signaling (Torres et al. 2006, Mou et al. 2003), these observations may indicate a functional link between the two UPR activating conditions.
PARÁGRAFO: In environmentally stressful conditions, the accumulation of unfolded and irremediably misfolded proteins leads to the activation of the UPR via IRE1 and bZIP28 (Figure 1). Although the activation mechanism of IRE1 has yet to be established in plants, studies of IRE1 in yeast have indicated that BiP binds the IRE1 luminal domain in non-stressful conditions. However, upon stress, BiP chaperones preferentially bind unfolded proteins thereby freeing the ER luminal domains of IRE1 (Pincus et al. 2010). Unfolded proteins then bind to IRE1 (Gardner and Walter 2011) which oligomerizes; as a consequence, the kinase domain in the cytosolic portion of the protein is autophosphorylated (Shamu and Walter 1996, Welihinda and Kaufman 1996). These steps lead to activation of the IRE1 ribonuclease domain (Cox and Walter 1996). In mammalian cells misfolded proteins bind to BiP chaperones which keep IRE1 in an inactive monomeric state under normal conditions (Berlotti et al. 2000). After dissociation from BiP, interactions between the freed luminal domains of IRE1 bring cytoplasmic domains together allowing the necessary autophosphorylation (Credle et al. 2005, Ali et al. 2011). Although the underlying mechanisms for activation of plant IRE1 are not known, it is certain that activation of IRE1 results in the unconventional cytosolic splicing of the mRNA transcripts of bZIP60, the only UPR target of plant IRE1 known to date (Deng, et al. 2011, Nagashima et al. 2011, Hayashi et al. 2012, Lu et al. 2012, Li et al. 2012 Moreno et al. 2012). In Arabidopsis, the tRNA ligase RLG1 was recently shown to complete the splicing of bZIP60 in vitro by ligating the fragments derived from IRE1 cleavage (Nagashima et al. 2016). Whether the ligation of bZIP60 spliced transcripts is mediated by RLG1 in vivo, while likely, has yet to be experimentally demonstrated, partly due to the lethality of complete RLG1 loss-of-function mutations (Nagashima et al. 2016). In yeast and mammalian cells, the ligation of the functional equivalents of bZIP60, Hac1 and XbpI, respectively, occurs via tRNA ligases that operate in opposite fashion. In detail, the ligation of Hac1 mediated by RLG1p in yeast is completed in a 5’-3’ fashion followed by removal of 2` phosphate group by a phosphatase (Sawaya et al. 2003, Steiger et al. 2005). In mammalian cells, the ligation is mediated by RTCB, which operates in a 3’-5’ ligation (Jurkin et al. 2014). Evidence suggests that plants have evolved a 5’-3’ ligation mechanism similar to that found in yeast, and this finding is supported by observations that Arabidopsis RLG1 can also ligate the Hac1 mRNA in yeast cells (Mori et al. 2010). However, the resulting Hac1 transcripts are not efficiently translated indicating that functional differences between yeast and Arabidopsis catalytic mechanisms remain. The splicing of bZIP60 leads to a frameshift that removes a transmembrane domain from the translated transcription factor. Spliced bZIP60 subsequently translocated to the nucleus for transcriptional modulation of the downstream UPR target genes. Intriguingly, the activity of IRE1 is not limited to unconventional splicing of a transcription factor. Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) is a process which regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. Such IRE1 mediated cleavage of cytosolic and ER-associated mRNAs has been implicated in promoting cell death in yeast (Tam et al. 2014). In metazoans, RIDD activity under prolonged or severe ER stress also has proapoptotic effects, and can be associated with human diseases such as diabetes (Maurel et al. 2014, Hetz and Glimcher 2011). RIDD activity was also described for the Arabidopsis IRE1 homolog (Mishiba et al. 2013), although the implications related to stress outcomes are yet to be tested in vivo.
PARÁGRAFO: Environmental stresses (e.g. heat, oxidative stress, selenium, chemical inhibitors) negatively affect the protein folding process, leading to the buildup of unfolded proteins. Plastid stress promotes the buildup of MEcPP (2-C-Methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate), which through an unknown mechanism, activates CAMTA3 (Calmodulin biding transcriptional activator 3) inducing transcription of bZIP60. 2. BiP ER luminal proteins bind unfolded proteins. The buildup of unfolded proteins leads to activation of IRE1 mediated splicing of bZIP60, which is then potentially ligated by the RNA ligase RLG1. The spliced bZIP60 is a nuclear localized transcription factor which binds to promoters of downstream UPR target genes, Regulated IRE1 dependent decay (RIDD) although not depicted here, regulates mRNA abundance and it is active during ER stress. 3. bZIP28 after being freed from BiPs by the presence of unfolded proteins is trafficked to the Golgi in a SAR1a/SEC23-dependent way. S2P proteases cleave the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain. bZIP28 enters the nucleus and acts redundantly with bZIP60 to transcriptionally activate the UPR.
PARÁGRAFO: Evidence that plant IRE1 assumes other roles besides the splicing of bZIP60, including RIDD and/or other yet-unknown activities of IRE1, can be found when comparing the stress responsive and vegetative phenotypic differences between IRE1 and bZIP60 loss-of-function mutants in Arabidopsis. Although no other direct splicing substrate has been found for IRE1 activity other that bZIP60 in plants, bzip60 knockout mutants are not nearly as sensitive as the ire1a/ire1b mutant to prolonged ER stress (Deng, et al. 2013, Mishiba, et al. 2013), implying diverse roles of IRE1 during the UPR. Whether these may depend on the ability of IRE1 to phosphorylate other substrates as opposed to its ribonuclease domain is a tantalizing idea that is yet to be experimentally tested. Furthermore, bzip60 plants are apparently indistinguishable from wild-type plants under normal conditions of growth, while IRE1 partial loss of function mutants (ire1a/ire1b) display shorter root growth as developmental defects, and ire1 null mutations are lethal (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Deng et al. 2013, Lu and Christopher 2008). Comparative analyses between bzip60 and ire1a/ire1b mutants under stressed and unstressed conditions may yet yield information that could potentially explain these physiological differences and provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms which tie IRE1 specifically to the control of plant health and cell fate decisions.
PARÁGRAFO: Although seemingly unimportant when compared with IRE1 or redundant when compared with other UPR signal transducers like bZIP28 (Sun et al. 2013a) in conditions tested thus far, bZIP60 appears to have unique contributions to the UPR management. Indeed, a close examination of the ER molecular phenotypes associated with bzip60 knockouts and expression patterns of bZIP60 yields some interesting information. The unspliced version of bZIP60 encodes a membrane bound transcription factor, and while it is found to be transcribed under normal conditions, the accumulation of the protein encoded by unspliced bZIP60 has been debated (Iwata et al. 2008, Iwata et al. 2009, Parra-Rojas et al. 2015). Although methods of detection between studies have been different, it has been shown that the product of the unspliced bZIP60 isoform accumulates to higher levels in seedlings treated with a proteasome inhibitor compared to untreated seedlings (Parra-Rojas et al. 2015). When this is taken into context with the observation that a cellular recycling process known as macroautophagy (hereafter termed autophagy) is constitutively active in the bzip60 knockout (Liu et al. 2012), it could be hypothesized that the dynamic levels of unspliced bZIP60 products are post-translationally subject to selective protein degradation and may regulate aspects of ER homeostasis, including protection of the ER against autophagy.
PARÁGRAFO: bZIP60 has also been shown to be transcriptionally regulated in conditions outside of the canonical UPR as well. In chloroplasts, reductive potential is funneled into carbon fixation and the synthesis of long carbon chains through the plastid isoprenoid metabolic pathway, collectively known as the methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway (Banerjee and Sharkey 2014). This biosynthetic track produces numerous molecular-end products, which range in function from growth and development (e.g., gibberellin precursors) to synthesis of isoprene gas, which protects chloroplast under heat stress (Banerjee and Sharkey 2014, Hedden and Thomas 2012, Sharkey 2005). Retrograde stress signaling mechanisms from chloroplasts to nucleus utilize the buildup of the MEP pathway intermediate methylerythritol cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP) in an abiotic stress dependent manner (Xiao et al. 2012). The CEH1 (1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl4-diphosphate synthase) enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of MEcPP to hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate (HMBPP) is dependent upon reductive potential of NADPH from the light reactions and, as a result, the activity of CEH1 is known to be oxidative stress sensitive (Ostrovsky et al. 1998). Fascinatingly, the MEcPP retrograde signal, transmitted in a calcium-dependent way via the calmodulin binding transcription activator 3 (CAMTA3), leads directly to transcriptional induction of bZIP60 (Benn et al. 2016). The possibility that the UPR responds to plastid metabolic dysfunction may also indicate that, like in humans (Ron and Walter 2007), the UPR may have tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming functions that have gone unnoticed in plants. This intracellular organelle bridge deserves further scrutiny, and its connection to the observations made by Ozgur et al. (2015) in their study of UPR activation under oxidative stress cannot be understated. When sourced from different organelles, ROS had highly variable effects in stimulating expression of some UPR genes while repressing others (e.g. methyl viologen induces BiP3 expression but heavily repressed BiP2 expression). Although bZIP60 expression and splicing have yet to be tracked under these conditions, this information could help identify mechanisms for selective upregulation or downregulation of UPR genes. This is especially valuable given that current studies of the two arms of the plant UPR are most often considered in the context of coordinated upregulation of UPR genes (Nagashima et al. 2014).
PARÁGRAFO: The ER transmembrane transcription factor bZIP28 is released from binding to BiP chaperones and is trafficked to the Golgi apparatus where putative site 1 and site 2 protease (S1P and S2P)-mediated proteolytic mechanisms split the active transcription factor from its transmembrane domain and allow its relocation to the nucleus (Gao et al. 2008, Liu et al. 2007, Srivastava et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2013, Sun et al. 2013c, Sun et al. 2015). Once in the nucleus the activated bZIP28 forms protein complexes with NF-Y transcription factors, and together bind specific ER stress related cis-elements (ERSE), which consist of two consensus sequences separated by 10 nucleotides (CCAAT-N10-CACG) and are commonly found in UPR upregulated gene promoter regions (Liu et al. 2010).
PARÁGRAFO: Looking beyond the functions of bZIP28 in the nucleus, recent work has elucidated the mechanisms by which bZIP28 is shuttled to the Golgi apparatus in an ER stress dependent fashion. In exploring the functional diversity of the COPII components involved in ER export, Zeng et al. (2015) mapped the biochemical interactions necessary for proper transfer of bZIP28 to the Golgi apparatus under ER stress. ER-to-Golgi transport is mediated by a specialized protein machinery collectively known COPII (Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2014). Assembly of this machinery requires SAR1, a GTPase that in the active form recruits the COPII coat components, SEC23/Sec24 and SEC13/SEC31. These components are required for cargo selection at the ER and shuttling to the Golgi. Although SAR1a shares high sequence identity to other secretion associated RAS-related GTPase homologs of the SAR1-family in Arabidopsis (Hanton et al. 2008), a single cysteine residue substitution at the amino acid position 84 was found to be required for interaction with SEC23a (Zeng et al. 2015). A dominant negative allele of SAR1a impaired the export of bZIP28 from the ER to the Golgi under tunicamycin-induced stress in Arabidopsis protoplasts. In contrast with other SAR1 and SEC23 homologs in Arabidopsis, the SAR1a/SEC23a pair is transcriptionally induced under ER stress conditions (Song et al. 2013). As such they may play an important role in promoting and sustaining the activity of bZIP28 during ER stress. This also opens up avenues to explore other conditions which could promote condition-specific trafficking of bZIP28, and subsequently potential activation of bZIP28 in developmental or growth contexts without activation of the canonical UPR cascade. This may be especially impactful with respect to bZIP28 functions in promoting brassinosteroid (BR) sensitivity (Che et al. 2010). S1P-S2P mediated cleavage of bZIP28 and another bZIP-transcription factor (bZIP17) under ER stress promote active BR signaling in adaptation to abiotic stress responses (Che et al. 2010). Although this phenomenon is presumed to be result of ERQC upregulation and increased delivery of functional client protein BRI1 sensor to the cell surface (Gendron and Wang 2007, Jin et al. 2007, Hong et al. 2008, Jin et al. 2009, Che et al. 2010), the exact mechanism through which bZIP28 and bZIP17 positively impact BR signaling remains to be discovered.
PARÁGRAFO: In contrast with the single bzip60 and bzip28 mutants, the bzip60 bzip28 double mutant shows enhanced susceptibility to prolonged ER stress (Deng et al. 2013), indicating both functional redundancy and potential cooperativity. Under ER stress conditions both bZIP60 and bZIP28 localize to the nucleus and have been shown to interact with each other to modulate the expression of UPR genes (Song et al. 2015). The recent findings implicating bZIP60 and bZIP28 in the direction of histone methylation activities of the COMPASS complex presents interesting opportunities for further study. In plants the COMPASS complex is responsible for increasing the frequency of trimethylation of histone 3 in the promoter region of actively expressed genes through association with an unidentified histone methyltransferase (Jiang et al. 2011). Previously, although there was strong evidence supporting the correlation between H3K4 histone trimethylation and gene transcription, no mechanisms were known to direct these epigenetic modifications in sequence-specific ways in plants (Li et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009). However, Song et al. (2015) showed that bZIP60 and bZIP28 interact with the proteins Ash2 (absent, small, homeotic like factor 2) and WDR5a (WD40 containing repeat 5a), which form the core elements of the COMPASS complex in plants (Jiang et al. 2011). Furthermore, the inducible expression of a subset of UPR responsive genes during ER stress was dramatically compromised in the wdr5a and ash2 mutants (Song et al. 2015). The lasting effects of these epigenetic marks after ER stress are not clear, but H3K4 trimethylation marks accumulate on genes involved in heat stress memory (Lämke et al. 2015). This may indicate that the UPR plays an important role in priming plants against future environmental stresses. Furthermore, H3K4 methylation and the COMPASS complex also play important roles in mediating temperature sensitive transitions in plant development (Jiang et al. 2011, Kumar and Wigge 2010, Zilberman et al. 2008). Exploring how UPR stress signaling and the constitutive functions of UPR related genes integrate with these epigenetic regulating mechanisms through bZIP28 and particularly bZIP60 might also provide useful insights into the developmental phenotypes found in ire1a/ire1b (Chen and Brandizzi 2012, Deng et al. 2013), which are deficient in bZIP60 splicing.
PARÁGRAFO: Nuclear translocation of spliced bZIP60 and cleaved bZIP28 leads to an increase in the transcription of genes coding for ER luminal proteins (BiP/Hsp70, ERdj/HSP40, HSP90), which (i) prevent aggregation of misfolded protein and newly translated polypeptides (Gupta et al. 2011), (ii) limit uncontrolled folding of nascent polypeptides through ERQC, and (iii) translocate terminally misfolded proteins across the ER membrane to the 26S proteasome by a group of membrane bound complexes in a processes collectively termed ER associated degradation (ERAD-L, -M and –C for luminal, membrane, and cytoplasmic ERAD, respectively (Olzmann et al. 2013). These downstream effectors, although largely conserved across eukaryotes, have been found to have specific significance in plants during normal growth and in response to ER stress (Klein et al. 2006, Liu et al. 2015, Yang et al. 2009). A noteworthy example of this is provided in the study of the plant specific properties of the conserved ER luminal chaperone HSP90.7, also known in Arabidopsis as SHEPHERD (SHD) (Ishiguro et al. 2002). When compared to the non-selective foldase activities of its mammalian counterpart GRP94, the designation of HSP90.7 as a general ER chaperone in plants (like BiP/HSP70) has been questioned (Klein et al. 2006, Marzec et al. 2012). In particular, Arabidopsis HSP90.7 which is highly upregulated under ER stress conditions was also found to have specific functions in proliferating tissues (Ishiguro et al. 2002, Klein et al. 2006). The shd (hsp90.7) knockout mutant is phenotypically identical to clv a mutant defective in CLAVATA signaling, a critical negative modulator of shoot apical meristem activity, indicating it may be required for plant specific production of the CLAVATA peptide (Aichinger et al. 2012, Miwa et al. 2009). Additional plant specific activities of HSP90.7 were demonstrated by Chong et al.(2014) who found that a short sequence of highly charged amino acids present only in plant ER-localized homologs drastically affected the survival rates of Arabidopsis seedlings under tunicamycin - and high calcium- induced ER stress. As expected overexpression of the HSP90.7 chaperone conferred significant resistance to tunicamycin, heat and high calcium induced ER stress; conversely overexpression of an HSP90.7 mutant with the highly charged 22 residue sequence deleted (HSP90.7Δ22 ), while still more resistant to heat stress than wild type, showed a marked increase in lethality in response to tunicamicyn compared to both native HSP90.7 overexpressor plants and even wild-type plants. These observations beyond illustrating plant specific chaperone functions also provide an important example which implies that in plants tunicamycin-induced stress may be responded to in a manner that is separate from heat induced ER stresses. Furthermore, it may be possible that the UPR directly mediates meristematic growth within undifferentiated tissues themselves through the HSP90.7/ CLAVATA relationship, perhaps in combination with transmission of signals through secondary messengers from distant tissues.
PARÁGRAFO: Further examples of UPR effectors which have plant-specific roles in growth and development can also be found with respect to ERdj3 (ER resident J domain 3) protein function during gametophyte development (Yamamoto et al. 2008). J domain proteins (Hsp40) found in the ER lumen bind BiP proteins and stabilize their interactions with client unfolded proteins (Misselwitz et al. 1998, Yamamoto et al. 2008). ERdj3A, which is induced under ER stress, contains a C-terminal protein disulfide isomerase domain that has reductive capabilities on substrates in vitro (Yang et al. 2009), in addition to a HSP40 ATPase activity (Ma et al. 2015). This suggests that ERdj3A may act on a specific subset of client proteins. Further in vivo analysis of ERdj3A and its homologs ERdj3B and P58IPK support this possibility by demonstrating their importance in development (Maruyama et al. 2014b). Indeed, genetic analysis of the mutant Thermosensitive male sterile 1 (tms1) revealed a nonfunctional allele of ERdj3A that under elevated temperatures was defective in pollen tube growth (Yang et al. 2009). Under normal conditions, in conjunction with P58IPK and ERdj3b, ERdj3A was also shown to mediate polar haploid nuclei fusion in female gametophytes (Maruyama et al. 2014b) prior to double fertilization. During this nuclear fusion process, the perinuclear ER fuses with the outer nuclear envelope and creates a continuous outer membrane around the two haploid nuclei, and it is followed by a second fusion of the inner nuclear membranes (Jensen 1964, Maruyama et al. 2010). Recently it was demonstrated that ERdj3A and P58IPK are required for the fusion of the ER membrane with the outer nuclear membranes. A double knockout (erdj3a p58IPK) resulted in seed abortion after fertilization due to aberrant endosperm proliferation, similar to that found in bip1 bip2 double mutants (Maruyama et al. 2010, Maruyama et al. 2014b). The inner membrane fusion requires the ERdj3B/ P58IPK pair, and although the erdj3b p58 IPK double mutants had unfused haploid nuclei in close proximity, unlike erdj3a p58IPK no aborted seeds were found (Maruyama et al. 2014a). The developmental defects found in plants with mutant alleles of UPR induced ER resident proteins (e.g., ERdj, BiP, SHD) are consistent with the evidence that pollen development in an ire1a ire1b double mutant is highly vulnerable to heat stress (Deng et al. 2016, Fragkostefanakis et al. 2016). However, the observed rescue of male fertility through the overexpression of a single COPII coat component SEC31a is intriguing given the large gene list shown to be regulated by IRE1 in these conditions (Deng et al. 2016). This underscores the need to fully understand the detailed functional mechanisms of downstream UPR components. Although studies exploring the similarities between yeast, mammalian, and plant UPR have led to significant advances in plant ER stress research, in order to fully understand the mechanisms connecting the UPR to plant specific physiology it will also be important to look at the contrasting characteristics. These plant specific cases, such as the single amino acid substitution in the case of SAR1a important for bZIP28 shuttling (Zeng et al. 2015), or the small charged region in the case of HSP90.7, which drastically alters stress responsive phenotypes compared to the deletion mutant (Chong et al. 2014), are potent reminders to expect the unexpected, even in evolutionarily conserved contexts.
PARÁGRAFO: In addition to the transcriptional activities of bZIP60 and bZIP28, a veritable menagerie of plant-specific transcription factors is involved in the response to ER stress (Figure 2) (Sun et al. 2013b, Yang et al. 2014a, Yang et al. 2014b). Thus far however, their mechanistic involvement in the UPR is yet to be fully elucidated. ANAC062 a plasma membrane-bound transcription factor, which is proteolytically cleaved and nuclear localized in response to cold stress, has been linked to the expression of multiple pathogenesis-related genes in a salicylic acid independent fashion and has also been shown to be upregulated under ER stress (Seo et al. 2010). Overexpression of a truncated form lacking the C-terminal membrane domain was shown to induce canonical UPR responsive chaperones and improve prolonged ER stress outcomes (Yang et al. 2014b), supporting a functional connection between ANAC062 and the UPR. Furthermore, ANAC103, a soluble nuclear transcription factor was shown to be transcriptionally induced under ER stress (Sun et al. 2013b). Overexpression of ANAC103 with a small C-terminal deletion to enhance stability of the expressed protein was also shown to induce UPR genes, although true knockouts showed no appreciable ER stress phenotype suggesting a functional redundancy between ANAC103 and other UPR related transcription factors in response to tunicamycin (Sun et al. 2013b). A third transcription factor, the membrane bound ANAC089, has been implicated in promoting programmed cell death in Arabidopsis. Inducible overexpression of truncated ANAC089 ignited mammalian apoptotic-like symptoms in roots (Yang et al. 2014a). RNAi lines targeting ANAC089 also displayed resistance to tunicamycin induced ER stress (Yang et al. 2014a). These results support earlier findings implicating ANAC089 in the control of ER-related homeostatic mechanisms. Smyczynsk et al. (2006) in their study of a conserved immunophilin peptidylprolyl cis-trans-isomerase PASTICCINO1 (PAS1) demonstrated through a series of biochemical experiments that PAS1 and ANAC089 (which they termed FAN, for FKBP associated NAC) interact in vivo and in vitro (Smyczynski et al. 2006). PAS1 is important in maintaining proper morphology during embryo development in Arabidopsis (Vittorioso et al. 1998). Expressed in response to cytokinin, ER-localized PAS1 associates with the VLCFA (very long chain fatty acid) synthesis complex and promotes sphingolipid biosynthesis and subsequently organ polarity through the lipids effect on the localization of the PIN1 efflux carrier (Roudier et al. 2010). A C-terminal domain of PAS1 is required for interaction and co-localization with ANAC089 (Smyczynski et al. 2006). That same domain is also required for nuclear exclusion of the PAS1. Interestingly, both PAS1 and ANAC089 are highly expressed in the mature embryo and were found to relocate from ER to the nucleus dependent upon exogenous 1-naphthaleneacetic acid treatment during cellular dedifferentiation in Arabidopsis root tips (Smyczynski et al. 2006). When overexpressed in the pas1 loss of function allele, the full-length ANAC089 resulted in partial complementation of the deformed growth phenotype (Smyczynski et al. 2006). When this is taken into account in the context of the RNAi knockdowns of ANAC089 under ER stress, it may be possible that the reduction of endogenous ANAC89 may perturb cytokinin-auxin balance in a manner that promotes cell divisions in spite of continued stress signals. Taken together, these ANAC transcription factors may indeed play important roles in the secondary activation of the UPR cascade; they might also play important roles in activation of the UPR in response to other stress or hormone signaling mechanisms. For example, in a manner opposite STT3a which seems to prevent the activation of the UPR in salt stress conditions (Koiwa et al. 2003), perhaps plants treated with tunicamycin in cold conditions may require NAC062 for full UPR gene expression regulation as cold signaling mechanisms may interfere with canonical activation of IRE1 or bZIP28. Expansion of combinatorial stress experiments incorporating tunicamycin-induced stress with other environmental stressors may give a more accurate picture of regulation, and downstream targets of these transcription factors. This may consequently lead to more information regarding the in vivo function of the unmodified transcription factors in relation to the unfolded protein response.
PARÁGRAFO: Several plant-specific transcription factors are upregulated under ER stress in an IRE1/bZIP28 dependent way. Two membrane-bound transcription factors, ANAC062 and ANAC089, have been shown to relocate to the nucleus under ER stress. ANAC062 also is nuclear localized under cold stress conditions. ANAC089 along with interactor PAS1 (PASTICCINO1) were also shown to relocate to the nucleus in roots treated with 1-naphthaleneacetic acid to induce dedifferentiation. ANAC103, a soluble transcription factor, was also shown to upregulate UPR genes upon over expression. Although truncated forms of these transcription factors were shown to upregulate UPR responsive genes, the molecular mechanisms of action of native transcription factors are still unknown. After upregulation by IRE1/bZIP28 dependent mechanisms, these transcription factors may respond to secondary signals which reinforce or alter UPR gene expression.
PARÁGRAFO: The molecular products assembled inside the ER have an ever expanding relevance to plants under environmental stress. Although many open questions still plague the study of the UPR in plants, including the identity of the molecular mechanisms for the activation and de-activation of the master regulator IRE1, the general relevance of the UPR maintaining ER homeostasis is clear. The ERQC and UPR maintain the folding capacity of the ER, and in doing so, enable a wide range of downstream processes from proper heat stress adaptation to defense against pathogens. Specifically, the downstream effectors of the UPR have been implicated in transcriptional and post transcriptional regulation of both ER homeostatic genes, and developmental processes. However, new oddities arising in research focusing upstream and downstream of the UPR offer ever expanding possibilities where the UPR may play a defining role in plant physiology. UPR activation in response to plastid metabolic dysfunction, and oxidative stress implicates the potential for the UPR to respond in many different signal transduction cascades that utilize reactive oxygen species as a secondary messenger. Further inquiry exploring the canonical UPR, in non-canonical and tissue-specific contexts may help elucidate hidden functions and better integrate our understanding of UPR functionality in plant life.
PARÁGRAFO: The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the entry point to the secretory pathway, the primary site of phospholipid synthesis, a hub for critical stress and growth signaling molecules and for the assembly a third of the proteome. The unfolded protein response (UPR) increases the protein folding capacity of the ER in response to stresses and through unknown means exerts control over plant growth and development. Here we review recent and exciting findings that explore potential molecular mechanisms that support efficient UPR in plants. We visualize the plant UPR as a network that incorporates energy availability, plant production needs, and environmental conditions into a cohesive output governing plant life.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In all eukaryotes, the unfolded protein response (UPR) relieves endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is a potentially lethal condition caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. In mammalian and yeast cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ER stress attenuate the UPR, negatively impacting cell survival. In plants, the relationship between the UPR and ROS is less clear. Although ROS develop during ER stress, the sources of ROS linked to ER stress responses and the physiological impact of ROS generation on the survival from proteotoxic stress are yet unknown. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana the respiratory burst oxidase homologs, RBOHD and RBOHF, contribute to the production of ROS during ER stress. We also demonstrate that during ER stress RBOHD and RBOHF are necessary to properly mount the adaptive UPR and overcome temporary and chronic ER stress situations. These results ascribe a cytoprotective role to RBOH-generated ROS in the defense from proteotoxic stress in an essential organelle, and support a plant-specific feature of the UPR management among eukaryotes.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stress, we examined the significance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we performed a large-scale comparative transcriptome profiling in wild type and various UPR-defective mutants during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially alters the expression of hundreds of stress-related genes compared with ground control conditions. Although expression of those genes varied in the UPR mutants on the ground, it was largely similar across the genotypes in the spaceflight condition. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.

PARÁGRAFO: Maintaining astronaut health throughout long-duration spaceflight is essential to the feasibility of a manned mission to Mars. The ground-based Mars500 experiment investigated long-duration health by isolating six astronauts for 520 days, the longest controlled human confinement study conducted to date. After 520 days, astronauts had uniform strength and lean body mass losses, and increased fasting plasma glucose, calprotectin, and neutrophil levels characteristic of intestinal inflammation but previous analyses revealed no common significant changes in gut microbiota. This study reanalysed data from early (days 7–45) and late (days 420–520) faecal samples and identified 408 exact sequence variants (ESVs), including 213 shared by all astronauts. Thirty-two ESVs were significantly differentially abundant over time, including depletion of keystone resistant starch degrading, anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitivity-associated species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Ruminococcus bromii, Blautia luti, Anaerostipes hadrus, Roseburia faecis, and Lactobacillus rogosae, and enrichment of yet-to-be-cultured bacteria. Additionally, the extraordinary experimental confinement allowed observation of microbiota potentially shared between astronauts and their habitat. Forty-nine species were shared, representing 49% and 12% of the human and environmental microbiome diversity, respectively. These findings reveal the microbiota which significantly altered in relative abundance throughout confinement, including species known to influence inflammation and host glucose homeostasis consistent with astronaut symptoms. Identification of microbiome alterations after 520 days of isolation represents a missing piece connecting Mars500 astronaut physiological studies. Knowledge of the impact of long-term confinement upon the human microbiome helps to improve our understanding of how humans interact with their habitats and is a valuable step forward towards enabling long-duration spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and high LET HZE (high atomic weight, high energy) particles act as powerful mutagens in both plants and animals. DNA damage generated by HZE particles is more densely clustered than that generated by gamma rays. To understand the genetic requirements for resistance to high versus low LET radiation, a series of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants were exposed to either 1GeV Fe nuclei or gamma radiation. A comparison of effects on the germination and subsequent growth of seedlings led us to conclude that the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of the two types of radiation (HZE versus gamma) are roughly 3:1. Similarly, in wild-type lines, loss of somatic heterozygosity was induced at an RBE of about a 2:1 (HZE versus gamma). Checkpoint and repair defects, as expected, enhanced sensitivity to both agents. The “replication fork” checkpoint, governed by ATR, played a slightly more important role in resistance to HZE-induced mutagenesis than in resistance to gamma induced mutagenesis.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Parabolic flights provide cost-effective, time-limited access to “weightless” or reduced gravity conditions, facilitating research and validation activities that complement infrequent and costly access to space. Although parabolic flights have been conducted for decades, reference acceleration profiles and processing methods are not widely available. Here we present a solution for collecting, analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during parabolic flights, which we validated during a Boeing 727-200F flight with 20 parabolas. All data and analysis code are freely available. Our solution can be integrated with diverse experimental designs, does not depend upon accelerometer orientation, and allows unsupervised classification of all phases of flight, providing a consistent and open-source approach to quantifying gravito-inertial accelerations (GIA), or g levels. As academic, governmental, and commercial use of space advances, data availability and validated processing methods will enable better planning, execution, and analysis of parabolic flight experiments, and thus facilitate future space activities.

PARÁGRAFO: The purpose of this work was to evaluate the protein and mRNA expression levels of multiple cytoskeletal proteins in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice that were euthanized onboard the United States Orbital Segment of the International Space Station 37 days after the start of the SpaceX-4 mission (September 2014, USA). The results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice, but there were significant changes in the mRNA expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation. The mRNA expression levels of DNA methylases, the cytosine demethylases Tet1 and Tet3, histone acetylase and histone deacetylase did not change, and the mRNA expression level of cytosine demethylase Tet2 was significantly decreased.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The heart and its cellular components are profoundly altered by missions to space and injury on Earth. Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (YAP1, RHOA) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (VIM, NES, DES, LMNB2, LMNA), non-canonical Wnt ligands (WNT5A, WNT9A), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (PLCG1, PRKCA) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (TNNT2, VWF, and RUNX2), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Over the past 20+ years, the U.S. Government has made significant strides in establishing research funding and initiating a portfolio consisting of subject matter experts on radiation-induced biological effects in normal tissues. Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations – cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts.

PARÁGRAFO: Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.

PARÁGRAFO: We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating (rM-CSF) factor for 14 days during the flight of space shuttle Space Transportation System (STS)-126. We tested the hypothesis that the receptor expression for M-CSF, c-Fms was reduced. We used flow cytometry to assess molecules on cells that were preserved during flight to define the differentiation state of the developing bone marrow macrophages; including CD11b, CD31, CD44, Ly6C, Ly6G, F4/80, Mac2, c-Fos as well as c-Fms. In addition, RNA was preserved during the flight and was used to perform a gene microarray. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome but increased proliferation by the bone marrow macrophages that were assayed after 14 days of space flight. There also was a surprising pattern of space flight influence on genes of the coagulation pathway. These data confirm that a space flight can have an impact on the in vitro development of macrophages from mouse bone marrow cells.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME). To determine what host components are important for bacterial replication, we performed microarray analysis on Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells by comparing host gene transcript levels between permissive and nonpermissive conditions for E. chaffeensis growth. Five-hundred twenty-seven genes had increased transcript levels unique to permissive growth conditions 24 h postinfection. We screened adult flies that were mutants for several of the “permissive” genes for the ability to support Ehrlichia replication. Three additional D. melanogaster fly lines with putative mutations in pyrimidine metabolism were also tested. Ten fly lines carrying mutations in the genes CG6479, separation anxiety, chitinase 11, CG6364 (Uck2), CG6543 (Echs1), withered (whd), CG15881 (Ccdc58), CG14806 (Apop1), CG11875 (Nup37), and dumpy (dp) had increased resistance to infection with Ehrlichia. Analysis of RNA by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that the bacterial load was decreased in these mutant flies compared to wild-type infected control flies. Seven of these genes (san, Cht11, Uck2, Echs1, whd, Ccdc58, and Apop1) encoded proteins that had mitochondrial functions or could be associated with proteins with mitochondrial functions. Treatment of THP-1 cells with double-stranded RNA to silence the human UCK2 gene indicates that the disruption of the uridine-cytidine kinase affects E. chaffeensis replication in human macrophages. Experiments with cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), a CTP synthetase inhibitor and cytosine, suggest that the nucleotide salvage pathway is essential for E. chaffeensis replication and that it may be important for the provision of CTP, uridine, and cytidine nucleotides.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Ehrlichia chaffeensis is a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium which causes the tick-borne disease human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis replicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host genes that control E. chaffeensis replication and infection in vivo in Drosophila, Uridine cytidine kinase and separation anxiety. Using the UAS-GAL4 RNAi system, we generated F1 flies (UAS-gene of interest RNAi x tissue-GAL4 flies) that have Uck2 or san silenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. When Uck2 or san were suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body, E. chaffeensis replicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections. Silencing of these genes in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands did not impact fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. Our data suggest that in Drosophila, E. chaffeensis replicates within the hemocytes, the insect homolog of mammalian macrophages, and in the fat body, the liver homolog of mammals.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In preparation for a space flight on STS-126, two in vitro culture systems were used to investigate macrophage colony stimulating factor-dependent macrophage differentiation from mouse primary bone marrow cells. The patented Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA)1 were operated in different orientations to determine their impact on macrophage growth and differentiation. Bone marrow cell parameters were determined after cells were grown in FPAs incubated at 37°C in vertical or horizontal orientations, and macrophage cell recovery was significantly higher from FPAs that were incubated in the horizontal orientation compared to “vertical” FPAs. Similarly, when bone marrow cells were grown in the Techshot bioreactor, there were significant differences in the numbers of macrophages recovered after 7 days, depending on movement and orientation of the bioreactor. Macrophage recovery was highest when the patented bioreactor was rotated in the horizontal, x-axis plane (merry-go-round fashion) compared to static and vertically, y-axis plane rotated (Ferris wheel fashion) bioreactors. In addition, the expression of F4/80 and other differentiation markers varied depending on whether macrophages differentiated in FPAs or in bioreactors. After 7 days, significant differences in size, granularity and molecule expression were seen even when the same primary bone marrow cells were used to seed the cultures. These data show that culture outcomes are highly dependent on the culture device and device orientation. Moreover, the impact of the culture system needs to be understood in order to interpret space flight data.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Obesity is characterized by an increased recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages to the adipose tissue (AT), leading to systemic inflammation and metabolic disease. The pathogenesis of this AT inflammation, however, remains to be elucidated. The circulating adipokine leptin is increased in obesity and is involved in immune cell function and activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of leptin in the induction of obesity-associated inflammation. We generated radiation chimeric C57BL/6J mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and challenged them with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice reconstituted with db/db bone marrow (WT/db), had significantly lower body weight and adiposity compared with mice with WT bone marrow (WT/WT). Gonadal AT in WT/db mice displayed a 2-fold lower expression of the inflammatory genes Tnfa, Il6, and Ccl2. In addition, gonadal fat of WT/db mice contained significantly fewer crown-like structures compared with WT/WT mice, and most of their AT macrophages expressed macrophage galactose-type C type lectin 1 (MGL1) and were C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)-negative, indicative of an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, WT/db mice exhibited greater insulin sensitivity compared with WT/WT mice. These data show that disrupted leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells attenuates the proinflammatory conditions that mediate many of the metabolic complications that characterize obesity. Our findings establish a novel mechanism involved in the regulation of obesity-associated systemic inflammation and support the hypothesis that leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Metabolic and immune mediators activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. Therefore, molecules that regulate metabolism often affect immune responses. Leptin is an adipokine that exemplifies this interplay. Leptin is the body’s major nutritional status sensor, but it also plays a key role in immune system regulation. To provide an in vitro tool to investigate the link between leptin and innate immunity, we immortalized and characterized a leptin receptor-deficient macrophage cell line, DB-1. The cell line was created using bone marrow cells from leptin receptor-deficient mice. Bone marrow cells were differentiated into macrophages by culturing them with recombinant mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor, and passaged when confluent for 6 months. The cells spontaneously immortalized at approximately passage 20. Cells were cloned twice by limiting dilution cloning prior to characterization. The macrophage cell line is diploid and grows at a linear rate for 4–5 days before reaching the growth plateau. The cells are MAC-2 and F4/80 positive and have phagocytic activity similar to primary macrophages from wild-type and leptin receptor-deficient mice. DB-1 cells were responsive to stimulation with interferon-γ as measured by increase in Nos2 transcript levels. In addition, DB-1 macrophages are not responsive to the chemotactic signaling of adipocyte conditioned media nor leptin when compared to primary WT macrophages. We believe that DB-1 cells provide a dependable tool to study the role of leptin or the leptin receptor in obesity-associated inflammation and immune system dysregulation.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. In particular, splenic B cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and Igκ variable gene usage. This included assessments of our bioinformatic workflow on Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq datasets and is specifically designed to reduce bias, capture the most information from Ig sequences, and produce a data set that provides other data mining options. We validated our workflow by comparing our normal mouse MiSeq data to existing murine antibody repertoire studies validating it for future antibody repertoire studies.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Antibody specificity and diversity are generated through the enzymatic splicing of genomic gene segments within each B cell. Antibodies are heterodimers of heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.

PARÁGRAFO: Sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.

PARÁGRAFO: This report concerns the preclinical development of TAK-754, an AAV8-based human factor VIII (FVIII) vector designed to deliver a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter for gene therapy in patients with hemophilia A. A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 1012 and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754.

PARÁGRAFO: Ab repertoire diversity plays a critical role in the host’s ability to fight pathogens. CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab–Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.

PARÁGRAFO: Ovarian steroids dramatically impact normal homeostatic and metabolic processes of most tissues within the body, including muscle, bone, neural, immune, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the ovary and estrous cycle is, therefore, critical to our understanding of all spaceflight experiments using female mice. Adult female mice (n = 10) were exposed to and sacrificed on-orbit after 37 days of spaceflight in microgravity. Contemporary control (preflight baseline, vivarium, and habitat; n = 10/group) groups were maintained at the Kennedy Space Center, prior to sacrifice and similar tissue collection at the NASA Ames Research Center. Ovarian tissues were collected and processed for RNA and steroid analyses at initial carcass thaw. Vaginal wall tissue collected from twice frozen/thawed carcasses was fixed for estrous cycle stage determinations. The proportion of animals in each phase of the estrous cycle (i.e., proestrus, estrus, metestrus, and diestrus) did not appreciably differ between baseline, vivarium, and flight mice, while habitat control mice exhibited greater numbers in diestrus. Ovarian tissue steroid concentrations indicated no differences in estradiol across groups, while progesterone levels were lower (p < 0.05) in habitat and flight compared to baseline females. Genes involved in ovarian steroidogenic function were not differentially expressed across groups. As ovarian estrogen can dramatically impact multiple non-reproductive tissues, these data support vaginal wall estrous cycle classification of all female mice flown in space. Additionally, since females exposed to long-term spaceflight were observed at different estrous cycle stages, this indicates females are likely undergoing ovarian cyclicity and may yet be fertile.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Understanding the effects of spaceflight on microbial communities is crucial for the success of long-term, manned space missions. Surface-associated bacterial communities, known as biofilms, were abundant on the Mir space station and continue to be a challenge on the International Space Station. The health and safety hazards linked to the development of biofilms are of particular concern due to the suppression of immune function observed during spaceflight. While planktonic cultures of microbes have indicated that spaceflight can lead to increases in growth and virulence, the effects of spaceflight on biofilm development and physiology remain unclear. To address this issue, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions: STS-132 and STS-135, and the biofilms formed during spaceflight were characterized. Spaceflight was observed to increase the number of viable cells, biofilm biomass, and thickness relative to normal gravity controls. Moreover, the biofilms formed during spaceflight exhibited a column-and-canopy structure that has not been observed on Earth. The increase in the amount of biofilms and the formation of the novel architecture during spaceflight were observed to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations in the media. However, flagella-driven motility was shown to be essential for the formation of this biofilm architecture during spaceflight. These findings represent the first evidence that spaceflight affects community-level behaviors of bacteria and highlight the importance of understanding how both harmful and beneficial human-microbe interactions may be altered during spaceflight.

PARÁGRAFO: The mission of NASA’s GeneLab database (https://genelab.nasa.gov/) is to collect, curate, and provide access to the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic (so-called ‘omics’) data from biospecimens flown in space or exposed to simulated space stressors, maximizing their utilization. This large collection of data enables the exploration of molecular network responses to space environments using a systems biology approach. We review here the various components of the GeneLab platform, including the new data repository web interface, and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) web portal, which will support the expansion of the database in the future to include companion non-omics assay data. We discuss our design for GEODE, particularly how it promotes investigators providing more accurate metadata, reducing the curation effort required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) specifically designed to support tools for the visualization of processed omics data. We review the outreach efforts by GeneLab to utilize the spaceflight data in the repository to generate novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses, including spearheading data analysis working groups, and a high school student training program. All these efforts are aimed ultimately at supporting precision risk management for human space exploration.

PARÁGRAFO: Space agencies have announced plans for human missions to the Moon to prepare for Mars. However, the space environment presents stressors that include radiation, microgravity, and isolation. Understanding how these factors affect biology is crucial for safe and effective crewed space exploration. There is a need to develop countermeasures, to adapt plants and microbes for nutrient sources and bioregenerative life support, and to limit pathogen infection. Scientists across the world are conducting space omics experiments on model organisms and, more recently, on humans. Optimal extraction of actionable scientific discoveries from these precious datasets will only occur at the collective level with improved standardization. To address this shortcoming, we established ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an international consortium of scientists who aim to enhance standard guidelines between space biologists at a global level. Here we introduce our consortium and share past lessons learned and future challenges related to spaceflight omics.

PARÁGRAFO: With the rise of commercial spaceflight and prospective human missions to Mars, a wider health range of humans will enter space for longer spans and at higher exposure to environmental stressors than ever before. Numerous adverse health effects have been observed in space, including bone demineralization and skeletal muscle atrophy, among others. Scientists across the world are conducting space omics studies to develop countermeasures for safe and effective crewed space missions. However, optimal extraction of scientific insight from such data is contingent on improved standardization. In response, we founded ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing), an international consortium of scientists who aim to enhance guidelines between space biologists globally. This paper informs scientists and data scientists from many fields about the challenges and future avenues of space omics and can serve as an introductory reference for new members in the space biology discipline.
PARÁGRAFO: Humans will be entering space for longer spans and at higher exposure to environmental stressors than ever before. Numerous adverse health effects have been observed in space, including bone demineralization and skeletal muscle atrophy. We have formed an international consortium of scientists who aim to develop better standardization guidelines of space biology (especially omics) data. Maximum extraction of scientific knowledge from these rare data can lead to countermeasures needed for safe and effective crewed space missions.
PARÁGRAFO: Humankind has entered a new era of deep space exploration, with space agencies announcing plans to put humans back on the Moon in preparation for the first crewed missions to Mars. Radiation, microgravity, altered atmospheric gas composition, isolation, and diet changes are some of the known stressors on humans in the space environment; these factors are expected to increase with mission duration and distance outside of low Earth orbit.1,2 Examples of adverse human health effects during spaceflight include bone demineralization,3 skeletal muscle atrophy,4 cardiovascular deconditioning,5 vestibular control,6 immune system suppression,7,8 and neuro-ocular ailments.9 It is necessary to better understand how spaceflight factors affect human health in order to develop the countermeasures needed for safe and effective crewed space missions. Moreover, critical elements of the space exploration infrastructure, including food and medical supplies, are insufficient for prolonged missions.10
PARÁGRAFO: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Twins Study further motivated the need for comprehensive, consortium-based approaches to study the long-term effects of spaceflight on humans.11 Here, nine research groups studied a single data type in detail while a tenth group performed a multi-omics synthesis to construct a systematic whole-body layout of the changes. The study found alterations in numerous data types, including telomere length, gene regulation, gut microbiome composition, body weight, carotid artery dimensions, and serum metabolite profiles. While many of these changes were transient, some persisted for over 6 months after return to Earth.11
PARÁGRAFO: While the NASA Twins Study represents a step change in space biology research, it is also anomalous. The vast majority of space biology experiments and datasets are generated using model organisms (Figure 1). Animal models are used to infer how spaceflight affects humans; plant models are used to elicit how crops can be cultivated in space for food and renewed oxygen sources; and microbes are studied to understand how space affects human microbiomes, plant-microbe interactions, and environmental cleanliness, while also advancing the fields of space biotechnology, planetary protection, and astrobiology.12,13 Specifically, the NASA Rodent Research (RR)14 and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)15,16 series are part of a long heritage of rodent experiments in space; the zebrafish, medaka fish, fruit fly, and worm have all been valuable models for studying the effects of microgravity (μg), hypergravity, and space stressors using much larger sample size17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and proper 1g controls in space via centrifuges and on ground via microgravity simulators;25 plant models are consistently flown to investigate gravitropism26 and now food production;27 and microbial models have been guests on Apollo,28 Space Lab 1,29 the Space Shuttle,30 and the International Space Station (ISS),31 with recent interest turning toward understanding the natural microbiomes of spaceships32,33 and astronauts.34
PARÁGRAFO: Example Uses, Pros, and Cons of Various Model Organisms Used in Space Omics Experiments
PARÁGRAFO: In all cases, space biologists around the world are increasingly reliant on omics approaches due to its ability to maximize the knowledge gained from rare spaceflight experiments (Figure S1). This includes epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics.11 While omics can generate vast quantities of data, potentially paving the way for successful space missions, optimal extraction of actionable scientific insights from these complex data will only occur with improved standardization and communication at the international level.
PARÁGRAFO: In recent years, various consortiums have formed to address the increasingly expensive, large, and complicated nature of biological data.35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 These committees implemented standards that significantly accelerated the scientific progress of their respective communities. The space omics community remains relatively new and can adopt successful frameworks from these exemplar groups. At the same time, guidelines developed by these groups cannot simply be replicated into the space omics discipline. Conducting biological research in spaceflight presents unique technical and biological challenges that have not been met before and will need to be specifically addressed by the international space biology community to ensure its success.
PARÁGRAFO: In response, we have formed a consortium called International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP). Our members are scientists who conduct space omics experiments funded by multiple space agencies in Japan (JAXA), Europe (including delegates from the European Space Agency [ESA] Space Omics Topical Team42), and the United States (NASA). We bring expertise related to the processing of space omics samples from humans, vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms, plants, and microbes; the implementation of multi-omics and systems biology approaches in space biology; and the normalization of spaceflight metadata. We are also informed with the latest developments across government, industry, and academia. Our mission is to develop, share, and encourage sample-processing standardization and metadata normalization of spaceflight omics experiments to allow for a better harmonization of data and increased gain of knowledge.
PARÁGRAFO: In this paper, we begin by describing examples of past lessons learned from omics studies on model organisms in space. These examples showcase the unique technical and biological challenges inherent to performing spaceflight omics and underline the need for improved standardization in the discipline. We then announce the current formation of ISSOP to address these needs at the international level. We close with a brief section with potential future avenues for ISSOP to bring standardized and systematic science to the space omics field.
PARÁGRAFO: There are a number of unique challenges during each stage of a space omics experiment. In this section, we summarize those challenges and any advances therein that have been achieved in recent years through model organism studies. We journey through this section in roughly the same order of stages that researchers conduct space omics research projects (Figure 2).
PARÁGRAFO: Roadmap of the Unique Challenges and Solutions during Each Stage of a Space Omics Experiment
PARÁGRAFO: The space omics community faces novel technical difficulties when planning spaceflight experiments. Basic challenges include logistical limitations in space, time, and finances. First, capacity limitations on orbiting platforms restrict the number of experimental replicates and variables, especially for rodent and plant studies. Small replicate numbers constrain statistical power and limit strain diversity. Genetically diverse crops will be crucial to foster robust bioregenerative life support systems in long-term space missions; however, the majority of plant species studied in space have been confined to low biomass species due to limited volume.43 Second, crew time is exceptionally limited for experimental procedures in spaceflight. In 2019, an hour of astronaut time was valued at $17,500,44 while the mean hourly wage in the United States for biochemists and biophysicists was $52.01.45 These numbers roughly indicate it can be more than 300 times more expensive to perform experiments on orbit versus terrestrially. It is difficult to perform certain procedures on the ISS due to the small crew size and the lack of laboratory equipment and experience compared with what is common in terrestrial laboratories. Third, repeating unsuccessful experiments and following up successful experiments are both difficult due to logistical and financial constraints and typically face much longer waiting times compared with experiments on the ground.43
PARÁGRAFO: Biological experiments during spaceflight are rarely performed using standard ground equipment. Developing special hardware and housing technology that can operate in spaceflight conditions is an ongoing challenge. In the past few decades, several space research platforms for animal and plant physiology have been developed.46, 47, 48, 49 Alongside these engineering advances, it has become clear that the hardware itself and how it is employed in experimental design must be carefully standardized and iteratively improved to mitigate unintentional confounding factors as they become better known.
PARÁGRAFO: For example, the standard rodent vivarium cages used in ground studies are unsuitable in microgravity. One hardware design that has proved to be an effective platform for rodent studies during spaceflight is the NASA Animal Enclosure Model (AEM).49 A recent meta-study compared AEM ground controls and vivarium ground controls by examining all datasets in the NASA GeneLab database that had samples for both conditions.50 The authors applied an unbiased systems biology approach that revealed substantial transcriptional differences in ground control rodents when only the habitat was changed.50 In particular, a mild hypoxic phenotype was observed in the AEM condition, possibly due to its intentional design to intake ambient air, thereby passively intaking higher CO2 concentrations implemented to match the spaceflight environment.50 Importantly, increased CO2 levels may cause a decrease in cognitive scores and an increase in headaches in humans.51,52 Overall, this study underlined the critical need for well-designed ground control experiments in order to address confounders that might otherwise lead to incorrect conclusions about the omics effects of spaceflight, something that has also been observed in flies cultivated in space.25
PARÁGRAFO: Plants also require special hardware designs for spaceflight, several of which have been used enough to understand that the hardware itself introduces extraneous variables. For example, Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware, which required no power and only limited crew time, was employed in numerous astrobotany experiments and found to have several shortcomings. The hardware itself reduced plant endodermal cell size, partially due to etiolated response to its dark environment.53 Similarly, the BRIC Petri Dish Fixation Unit (BRIC-PDFU) hardware induces stress-related changes in the transcriptome and proteome of Arabidopsis seedlings, highlighting the continued need for iterative hardware revisions henceforth.54
PARÁGRAFO: The spaceflight community redevelops hardware not only to improve design but also to add new features that conserve time and effort for crew members. These features include real-time imaging, ground commanding, and automated software. New features are also added to better differentiate between the combinatorial effects of living in space. For example, in contrast to the NASA BRIC and BRIC-PDFU platforms, both the European KUBIK incubator and the JAXA Multiple Artificial-Gravity Research System (MARS) platforms provide 1g in-flights controls.15 These controls may mitigate the risk of falsely identifying omics results as responsive to microgravity exposure when they are instead relevant to other spaceflight variables.
PARÁGRAFO: Nonetheless, we note that, as is the case with most innovative spacecraft housing units, these platforms themselves introduce their own confounding influences. In particular, gravity gradients appear across the rotor system and sample positions do not experience the same gravity force. Given that small differences in partial gravity exposure cause large transcriptional profiles changes in plants,55,56 it is paramount for plant biologists who use these platforms to publish metadata that include both nominal partial g and real partial g for each sample position.
PARÁGRAFO: The use of reliable 1g controls both on Earth and in orbit is greatly acknowledged.24,57,58 A large variety of ground-based simulation systems55 can be used together to dissect the differential contribution of each confounding factor introduced by spaceflight or hardware requirements. Microgravity simulators include 2D clinostats, random positioning machines (RPMs), rotating wall vessels (RWVs), and diamagnetic levitation.59 Each of these simulators brings specific artifacts; for instance, clinostats introduce centrifugal accelerations and vibrations and diamagnetic levitation affects cell components differently based on magnetic susceptibility.59 For these reasons, consistent terminology must be used and standards must be proposed for different simulators and different modes of operation.59
PARÁGRAFO: We note that commercial platforms are increasingly being contracted for spaceflight biological experiments, including TangoLabs (Space Tango, Lexington, KY), NanoLabs (NanoRacks, Houston, TX), and ICE Cubes Facilities (Space Application Services, Sint-Stevens-Woluwe, Belgium). To improve standardization and share lessons learned, communication will be increasingly crucial between the academic, government, and industry sectors developing and improving upon hardware designs. Consistent metadata collection about hardware used will also be crucial for informed interpretation of space omics data.
PARÁGRAFO: Due in part to limitations in crew time and finances, inconsistencies have arisen in how samples are obtained for analysis. For example, in some rodent experiments, animals are euthanized in space (“ISS terminal”) and either preserved as whole frozen carcasses (“ISS terminal frozen return”) for eventual dissection on Earth or dissected immediately by astronauts (“ISS terminal dissected return”). Alternatively, animals can be returned to Earth alive for euthanasia and dissection (“live animal return”). Each method has its strengths and weaknesses: While ISS-terminal approaches fix spaceflight responses directly, live animal return saves the time and specialized training astronauts would need to perform fine anatomical dissection on the ISS and ensure that these procedures are instead performed by professional technicians on Earth. Live animal return also allows scientists to study the offspring of returned spaceflight mice and to examine recovery to Earth conditions. On the downside, live animal return is confounded by exerted forces during reentry, reacclimation to Earth conditions after splashdown and before dissection, and circadian rhythm differences.
PARÁGRAFO: Adequate preservation of samples aboard the ISS is a continuing challenge and a hindrance to capturing unchanged biological responses to the orbital environment. Without access to liquid nitrogen, the current tissue freezing standard on the ISS is −80°C slow freezing. Unfortunately, NASA Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) missions revealed that space mouse gene expression analysis may not be reliable with slow freezing.14 Indeed, slow freezing of mouse carcasses on orbit for eventual dissection on Earth (ISS terminal frozen return samples) showed large gene expression changes when compared with mice dissected by astronauts in orbit (ISS terminal dissected return samples). This appeared to be exacerbated by the use of poly(A) enrichment-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) protocol, and could be alleviated by the use of a ribodepletion-based approach and by snap-freezing carcasses in liquid nitrogen.60 As a result, the Rapid Freeze hardware was recently developed for use on the ISS. The device can freeze mouse tissues (Glovebox freezer) and whole carcasses (Cryochiller) at rates similar to those attained with liquid nitrogen immersion. Studies are ongoing to determine how this new hardware compares with current ISS standard methods.
PARÁGRAFO: RNAlater consists of quaternary ammonium sulfates and cesium sulfates that denature and deactivate ribonucleases to prevent sample degradation. It is one fixative that has been widely used in space omics because it efficiently preserves nucleic acids and is deemed safe in the orbital environment. However, a secondary control study found that numerous genes identified in spaceflight experiments exhibit more pronounced differential expression induced by RNAlater than by microgravity.61 The fixation process is not rapid enough to prevent a response to the preservative in plants or invertebrates. Under normal circumstances, parallel fixation of treatment and control samples would account for the preservation effects. However, spaceflight is by no means a normal circumstance: it is likely that the fixation process is markedly altered in microgravity, which induces sweeping alterations to structural components of plants and invertebrates and differences in fluid dynamics. Ultimately, transcriptomic experiments performed aboard the ISS should preferentially use snap-freezing preservation. In the absence of snap-freezing capabilities, experimentalists should examine the overlap in response to RNAlater and their experimental treatments to eliminate potential fixative-induced transcriptome events.61,62
PARÁGRAFO: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project significantly enhanced our understanding of complex biology with its carefully curated and publicly available multi-omics database.36 In order to unravel how biology responds to space factors, the space omics community needs to capture this spirit and construct an analogous database tailored to the unique characteristics of space omics data. NASA GeneLab is the first comprehensive space omics database that aims to optimize scientific return from spaceflight and ground simulation experiments funded by multiple space agencies around the world.63 The repository currently maintains more than 300 transcriptomic, epigenomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets from plant, animal, and microbial space experiments. Users can upload, download, store, and analyze spaceflight-relevant omics data in an open-access manner.
PARÁGRAFO: GeneLab complies with FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles64,65 and houses raw, intermediate, and fully processed data files. This renders the data accessible to citizen scientists and scientists at every level. Users can fully reproduce each step of the analysis pipeline and reanalyze data using their preferred bioinformatics tools starting from any step in the pipeline. As raw and intermediate files lack interpretable biological meaning, processed data files contain user-friendly menus that allow users to easily explore statistical comparisons and visualizations between data in order to generate new space biology hypotheses at high and interconnected levels.66
PARÁGRAFO: The power of a database is greater than the sum of its individual datasets, but only if its individual datasets can be cross-examined in intelligent ways that assist with pattern discovery. Metadata are datasets that provide information about other datasets and hence are the bedrock of interconnecting datasets in informed manners. For this reason, implementation of best practices for metadata is just as important as for the datasets themselves.
PARÁGRAFO: GeneLab links critical metadata to each dataset. Metadata cover numerous factors that may present confounding variables during space omics experiments: biology factors (such as age, gender, strain, and ecotype), lifestyle factors (such as diet, exercise, and light cycle), experimental design factors (such as hardware and preflight and postflight exposure to stressors), sample-processing factors (such as preservation methods and library preparation methods), and spaceflight factors (such as gravity, atmospheric pressure, temperature, and ionizing radiation). Overall, metadata can be systematically examined to create robust networks that predict confounding variables and eventually determine additional experimental and engineering improvement areas for spaceflight omics studies.67
PARÁGRAFO: Metadata protocols continue to be refined in the space biology discipline. For example, ISS environmental metadata (such as CO2, temperature, and radiation levels) are now integrated in space omics data.68 Dosimeters are not typically incorporated in the housing units of space omics experiments; hence, dosage exposure for study samples must be extrapolated from surrounding dosimeters.68 Meticulous metadata standardization efforts will continue to evolve and solve such challenges. External tools are also being developed to facilitate metadata reproducibility and discoverability. The Gilroy Astrobiology Team at the University of Wisconsin developed a metadata visualization API for the GeneLab platform called TOAST (Test of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome) and a cross-species transcriptional viewer (NASA GeneLab Cross Kingdom Database) that uses iterative approaches to assist users with discovering common gene clusters among space omics datasets.68
PARÁGRAFO: As much as possible, space biologists employ standardized ontological vocabularies accepted by the larger scientific community through the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI). However, given the unprecedented nature of space biology, terminology must sometimes be extended from the OBI. This has been the case especially for radiobiology and space radiation terms. The addition of new ontology terms must be done carefully in manners that support controlled integration between datasets and metadata sources.69
PARÁGRAFO: Normalizing metadata is another enormous manual effort, sometimes requiring interviewing principal investigators and perusing publications to procure critical metadata. With growing volumes of incoming space omics datasets, this ambitious effort cannot be scaled.69 Going forward, submission portals can be created to increase automatic curation, which has already been proved relatively successful in non-spaceflight applications.69 Algorithms can guide data submitters to deposit crucial metadata and even provide explanations for why certain metadata are essential. Successfully relaying the importance of space omics confounders to researchers will improve their metadata submission adherence, thereby increasing the automation of metadata curation and the reliability of cross-data studies. Recent groups have indeed demonstrated the power of integrating multiple datasets from the GeneLab database to elicit global systemic responses to the space environment.50 Future studies can similarly leverage the database and its thorough metadata to obtain the larger sample sizes and stronger statistical powers needed to further identify salient factors affecting space-flown organisms.
PARÁGRAFO: Deciphering fundamental molecular responses to space will likely not be achieved by a single research group. Sample-sharing schemes must be honed to maximize discoverability and reproducibility between researchers in the space omics discipline. To this end, sharing a common biobank and sample-processing facility is ideal. An organized, navigable biobank can allow researchers to determine whether tissues of interest are already available from previous studies and avoid conducting redundant, resource-consuming experiments in space. A central sample-processing facility can prevent batch effects that would otherwise be introduced in a multiple-facility configuration. The common facility can generate high-quality data using standard operating procedures (SOPs) performed by specially trained laboratory operators and robotic workstations. Overall, this framework would be in congruence with successful multi-omics endeavors, such as the TCGA project, where each type of omics was managed by a single center.36
PARÁGRAFO: Fortunately, space omics-sharing schemes are already implemented in Japan and the United States. A typical JAXA mouse live animal return study consists of 12 mice, producing more than 30 different tissue types across multiple omics assays that are then shared by more than 10 primary investigators. Genomics datasets from spaceflight mice are processed in a common laboratory at the University of Tsukuba that implements automated sample processing using LabDroids.70 In the United States, unused frozen spaceflight samples from previous experiments are often archived in the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program of the Life Sciences Data Archive. GeneLab scientists at the sample-processing laboratory process these samples and generate omics data using standardized methods for data reproducibility. While ESA does not have its own sample-sharing schemes, it does encourage multinational spaceflight experiments with sample sharing between European researchers and it does participate bilaterally with JAXA and NASA schemes. As the discipline forges onward, valuable sharing schemes for these rare and costly biological specimens returned from orbit should continue to be perfected.
PARÁGRAFO: With an increasing reliance on and promise of omics technologies when properly standardized, and with different countries providing specific expertise, we have formed to create guidelines for space omics data with input from scientists at the global level. We envision that, as the field of human space omics matures, our guidelines can be readily extended from animal models to humans and to specifically allow for translatable inference and comparison between animal model data and human data. Our latest protocols will be available on our consortium website (https://issop.space) and GitHub (https://github.com/ISSOP) as they are developed and continuously updated.
PARÁGRAFO: Here we announce the inception of the ISSOP consortium. ISSOP is a portmanteau of the abbreviations ISS and SOP. We are an international consortium of scientists with a 3-fold mission statement. First, we develop, share, and encourage sample-processing standardization and metadata normalization of spaceflight omics experiments. Second, we aim to optimize the conditions for scientists and the general public to derive valid hypotheses from these precious data by reducing confounding factors and increasing interoperability at the global level. Third, our standardization efforts are crucial for understanding the effects of spaceflight on biological organisms and preparing the international community toward developing safe and effective crewed space exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Our objectives, deliverables, and expected impacts are listed in Table 1.
PARÁGRAFO: Objectives, Deliverables, and Expected Impacts of ISSOP
PARÁGRAFO: ISSOP meets regularly virtually and at the American Society for Gravitational and Space Research (ASGSR) conference, where we can communicate latest standardization guidelines to and from various industry representatives. Our collaborative meetings are designed to identify mechanisms to increase the impact of future space omics experiments while sharing new data and analysis methods. We invite interested readers to contact ISSOP with inquiries or suggestions at issop@issop.space. Corresponding authors in the current paper can also be contacted with questions specific to each geographical region within ISSOP (R.H. for Europe, M.M. for Japan, and J.M.G. for the United States).
PARÁGRAFO: In this paper, we discussed the challenges of performing omics experiments in spaceflight on model organisms. An international consortium of scientists who bring expertise in space omics studies across a breadth of assay types and model organisms can best advance the field in a multifaceted manner. In future work, ISSOP can develop space omics recommendations across individual assays, including proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics. Guidelines can also be developed for lesser-known but promising molecular biology laboratory techniques. For instance, JAXA and NASA projects have recently started to utilize laser microdissection (LMD) and spatial transcriptomics respectively for data collection at the tissue-part-specific level as opposed to simply the tissue-specific level. ISSOP members who participate in these studies can develop standardization protocols in the context of space omics. Best practices can also be proposed for various organisms. For example, as mentioned previously, physical limitations on orbit restrict sample sizes in certain organisms, including plants. ISSOP members with expertise in astrobotany can provide guidance on standards to maximize information from small numbers of samples during spaceflight. Digitization of sample handling with advanced robotics will be one of the important components for future remote experiments and project sharing. In total, ISSOP can present diverse and balanced guidelines for conducting space omics experiments across a range of assay types and model organisms; these guidelines can include quantitative and qualitative information about data collection, data extraction, library preparation, quality control, sample preservation, and sequencing parameters. It may be possible to eventually consolidate this information into a protocol decision tree algorithm that can provide standardized recommendations to principal investigators based on their organisms and assays of interest.
PARÁGRAFO: The challenges delineated in this paper will be further intensified as we leap into an age of human space omics. Commercial spaceflight will induce a wider health range of humans entering space while future long-term deep space missions will expose humans to more intense environmental stressors for longer durations than ever before. Fine-tuning the space telemedicine field will be necessary for these ambitious frontiers and will best be achieved with the addition of omics as a standard measures program. Pioneering crewed missions to Mars will likely require international input due to complexities in the technology and cultural ethics of working with human subjects.71 ISSOP may be uniquely positioned to leverage lessons learned thus far from model organisms to develop an informed framework early on that can maximize scientific discovery and minimize ethical problems for an upcoming era of human space omics. Compellingly, careful standardization of space omics data through ISSOP may pave the way for cell space atlases72,73 and precision spaceflight medicine74, 75, 76, 77, 78 that will critically improve the safety of humans traveling through space.
PARÁGRAFO: Here we have introduced ISSOP as an international consortium that can prime researchers to extract as much actionable insight as possible from space omics data through improved standardization, altogether benefiting upcoming trailblazing space missions during this critical period. This paper is intended to inform scientists and data scientists across a wide spectrum of disciplines about the challenges and future directions of the exciting field of space omics. This paper can also serve as an introductory reference for students and new members in the space omics and larger space biology discipline. We invite interested readers to learn more about ISSOP through our webpage. Satellite ISSOP papers will follow with more detailed focuses on specific realms of standard space omics processing, all intended to improve our understanding of the omics effects of spaceflight so humanity can reach new worlds safely.

PARÁGRAFO: About the Organization
PARÁGRAFO: The International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP) is an international consortium of scientists who recognize the growing need for sample-processing standardization and metadata normalization of space omics studies at the global level. It was created early in 2020 with a balanced international scope with perspectives from multiple space communities from Japan (including Living in Space, Omics Subgroup), Europe (including Space Omics Topical Team), and the United States (including GeneLab Analysis Working Group). ISSOP plans to develop standardized science for these data to enhance the robustness of the field and potentially launch an upcoming era of human space omics.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: There has long been an interest in understanding how the hazards from spaceflight may trigger or exacerbate human diseases. With the goal of advancing our knowledge on physiological changes during space travel, NASA GeneLab provides an open-source repository of multi-omics data from real and simulated spaceflight studies. Alone, this data enables identification of biological changes during spaceflight, but cannot infer how that may impact an astronaut at the phenotypic level. To bridge this gap, Scalable Precision Medicine Oriented Knowledge Engine (SPOKE), a heterogeneous knowledge graph connecting biological and clinical data from over 30 databases, was used in combination with GeneLab transcriptomic data from six studies. This integration identified critical symptoms and physiological changes incurred during spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Impairment of the central nervous system (CNS) poses a significant health risk for astronauts during long-duration space missions. In this study, we employed an innovative approach by integrating single-cell multiomics (transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate the impact of spaceflight on the mouse brain in female mice. Our comparative analysis between ground control and spaceflight-exposed animals revealed significant alterations in essential brain processes including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission, particularly affecting the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and neuroendocrine structures. Additionally, we observed astrocyte activation and signs of immune dysfunction. At the pathway level, some spaceflight-induced changes in the brain exhibit similarities with neurodegenerative disorders, marked by oxidative stress and protein misfolding. Our integrated spatial multiomics approach serves as a stepping stone towards understanding spaceflight-induced CNS impairments at the level of individual brain regions and cell types, and provides a basis for comparison in future spaceflight studies. For broader scientific impact, all datasets from this study are available through an interactive data portal, as well as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Open Science Data Repository (OSDR).

PARÁGRAFO: With precious few spaceflight missions, all space-related biological and biomedical-health data are priceless national resources that anyone should be able to easily access. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR: https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio) plays a crucial role in ensuring such accessibility, housing comprehensive space-related datasets derived not only from various model organisms but also from non-NASA human astronauts1. These datasets cover a wide spectrum of biological assays conducted at multiple levels, ranging across cells, tissues, organs, and whole organisms. They effectively capture diverse types of data, including ‘omics, phenotypic, physiological, and behavioral changes experienced in space2,3. Additionally, OSDR enriches this data by providing metadata contextualizing each experiment including the associated experimental hardware and environmental telemetry. OSDR has worked with a large and open scientific community to standardize data generation and formatting, enabling advanced analytics, including the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis.
PARÁGRAFO: With the support of NASA’s scientific leadership, the spirit of Open Science has permeated every scientific division at NASA, including the Biological and Physical Science (BPS) Division. The BPS Division has emerged as a pivotal force in fueling humanity’s fascination with space exploration by understanding the mechanisms of life adapting to extreme environmental hazards of deep space4. As NASA launched the ambitious "Transform to Open Science" program (TOPS)5 in 2023, it aims to accelerate the adoption of a more reproducible and transparent approach to research. TOPS also aims to train 20,000 scientists in the art of Open Science by 2028 (https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/), pushing for better equity and inclusivity in science. Within the BPS Division, the curation of an extensive array of space biological, space health, and mission telemetry data in standardized formats has been vetted by over 500 citizen scientists, members of the NASA OSDR Analysis Working Groups (AWG - https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/awg/join.html). As a result, OSDR system ensures the invaluable data’s findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR)6, despite the challenges posed by its multi-hierarchical, multimodal, and heterogeneous nature.
PARÁGRAFO: As a celebration of 2023 being the year of Open Science at NASA, a Nature portfolio Collection titled "The Second Space Age: Omics, Platforms, and Medicine Across Orbits7,’’ is a series of inspiring articles enabled by OSDR, enriched by new data generously shared by civilian astronauts aboard the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. The investigator team involved in this work has embraced Open Science by sharing research data and enabling data mining by the AWG community. Data presented in this Nature portfolio Collection were fully utilized because of the open and accessible nature of the OSDR system. This array of work shows how NASA handled the storage and reuse of a diverse range of data from molecular to ecosystem levels, encompassing tabular, omics, imaging, code, video, biospecimens, and environmental physical-chemical telemetry data. The AWGs played a critical role standardizing metadata and data processing pipelines in OSDR, enabling groundbreaking discoveries in space biology and biomedical health by making meta-analysis possible. In this context, two recent articles involving the AWGs were published in Nature Machine Intelligence and featured in a special issue on AI, detailing the future role of AI and Open Science in deep space biological research8 and biomedical health support9, describing how Open Science and standardization integrated with AI can maximize the value of limited yet vital spaceflight data.
PARÁGRAFO: The spirit of Open Science and the invaluable insights from space biology have transcended boundaries, extending their embrace to other vital groups within NASA, including the Human Research Program (HRP) focused on the health and performance of NASA Astronauts. This Open Science approach champions practical, collaborative scientific discovery, with an emphasis on data sharing and immediate applications. Insights from space biology, facilitated by Open Science, are vital not just for aspirational goals like moon and Mars missions, but for direct advancements in human health and technology on earth. This Nature portfolio Collection highlights how collective efforts and open data can drive substantial scientific progress, merging the thrill of cosmic exploration with tangible and immediate benefits.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The increasing accessibility of commercial and private space travel necessitates a profound understanding of its impact on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven data standards established by NASA’s OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, propelling research in the burgeoning field of commercial space travel’s impact on human physiology.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. It is evident that the spaceflight environment causes multiple alterations to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions. However, the level of overlap between species was found to be significantly limited, partly attributed to the limited availability of human samples.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Human occupied built environments are no longer confined to Earth. In fact, there have been humans living and working in low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station (ISS) since November 2000. With NASA’s Artemis missions and the age of commercial space stations set to begin, more human-occupied spacecraft than ever will be in Earth’s orbit and beyond. On Earth and in the ISS, microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. However, we do not yet know how indoor microbiomes in Earth-based homes and in the ISS differ due to their unique set of environmental conditions. Here we show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on Earth and the ISS, with Earth-based homes being more diverse (465 fungal OTUs and 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs and 102 bacterial ASVs). When dust from these locations were exposed to varying equilibrium relative humidity conditions (ERH), there were also significant fungal community composition changes as ERH and time elevated increased (Bray Curtis: R2 = 0.35, P = 0.001). These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection.

PARÁGRAFO: Bone loss with aging and menopause may be linked to vascular endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of the study was to determine whether putative modifications in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur are associated with changes in trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) with altered estrogen status in young (6 mon) and old (24 mon) female Fischer-344 rats. Animals were divided into 6 groups: 1) young intact, 2) old intact, 3) young ovariectomized (OVX), 4) old OVX, 5) young OVX plus estrogen replacement (OVX+E2), and 6) old OVX+E2. PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation was assessed in vitro using acetylcholine. Trabecular bone volume of the distal femoral metaphysis was determined by microCT. In young rats, vasodilation was diminished by OVX and restored with estrogen replacement (intact, 82±7; OVX, 61±9; OVX+E2, 90±4%), which corresponded with similar modifications in BV/TV (intact, 28.7±1.6; OVX, 16.3±0.9; OVX+E2, 25.7±1.4%). In old animals, vasodilation was unaffected by OVX but enhanced with estrogen replacement (intact, 55±8; OVX, 59±7; OVX+E2, 92±4%). Likewise, modifications in BV/TV followed the same pattern (intact, 33.1±1.6; OVX, 34.4±3.7; OVX+E2, 42.4±2.1%). Furthermore, in old animals with low endogenous estrogen (i.e., intact and old OVX), vasodilation was correlated with BV/TV (R2 = 0.630; P<0.001). These data demonstrate parallel effects of estrogen on vascular endothelial function and BV/TV, and provide for a possible coupling mechanism linking endothelium-dependent vasodilation to bone remodeling.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Chronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine 1) whether 7 and 14 days of skeletal unloading alters femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance during reloading, and 2) whether putative changes in bone perfusion are associated with a gross structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur. Six-month old male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 7-d or 14-d hindlimb unloading (HU) or weight-bearing control groups. Bone perfusion was measured following 10 min of standing (reloading) following the unloading treatment. Histomorphometry was used to determine PNA media wall thickness and maximal diameter. Bone blood flow, arterial pressure and PNA structural characteristics were used to calculate arterial shear stress and circumferential wall stress. During reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7-d HU rats, and in the proximal and distal metaphyses, diaphysis and diaphyseal marrow of 14-d HU animals relative to that in control rats. Vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14-d HU rats during reloading relative to control animals. Intraluminal diameter of PNAs from 14-d HU rats (138 ± 5 μm) was smaller than that of control PNAs (162 ± 6 μm), and medial wall thickness was thinner in PNAs from 14-d HU (14.3 ± 0.6 μm) versus that of control (18.0 ± 0.8 μm) rats. Decreases in both shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the PNA with HU that later returned to control levels with the reductions in PNA maximal diameter and wall thickness, respectively. The results demonstrate that chronic skeletal unloading attenuates the ability to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow with immediate acute reloading due, in part, to a remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Adipose tissue (AT), which typically comprises an increased percentage of body mass with advancing age, receives a large proportion of resting cardiac output. During exercise, an old age-associated inability to increase vascular resistance within the intra-abdominal AT may compromise the ability of the cardiovascular system to redistribute blood flow to the active musculature, contributing to the decline in exercise capacity observed in this population. We tested the hypotheses that 1) there would be an elevated perfusion of AT during exercise with old age that was associated with diminished vasoconstrictor responses of adipose-resistance arteries, and 2) chronic exercise training would mitigate the age-associated alterations in AT blood flow and vascular function. Young (6 mo; n = 40) and old (24 mo; n = 28) male Fischer 344 rats were divided into young sedentary (YSed), old sedentary (OSed), young exercise trained (YET), or old exercise trained (OET) groups, where training consisted of 10-12 wk of treadmill exercise. In vivo blood flow at rest and during exercise and in vitro α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstrictor responses in resistance arteries from AT were measured in all groups. In response to exercise, there was a directionally opposite change in AT blood flow in the OSed group (∼150% increase) and YSed (∼55% decrease) vs. resting values. Both α-adrenergic and myogenic vasoconstriction were diminished in OSed vs. YSed AT-resistance arteries. Exercise training resulted in a similar AT hyperemic response between age groups during exercise (YET, 9.9 ± 0.5 ml·min−1·100−1 g; OET, 8.1 ± 0.9 ml·min−1·100−1 g) and was associated with enhanced myogenic and α-adrenergic vasoconstriction of AT-resistance arteries from the OET group relative to OSed. These results indicate that there is an inability to increase vascular resistance in AT during exercise with old age, due, in part, to a diminished vasoconstriction of AT arteries. Furthermore, the results indicate that exercise training can augment vasoconstriction of AT arteries and mitigate age-related alterations in the regulation of AT blood flow during exercise.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Following exposure to microgravity, there is a reduced ability of astronauts to augment peripheral vascular resistance, often resulting in orthostatic hypotension. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mesenteric arteries and veins will exhibit diminished vasoconstrictor responses after spaceflight. Mesenteric arteries and veins from female mice flown on the Space Transportation System (STS)-131 (n=11), STS-133 (n=6), and STS-135 (n=3) shuttle missions and respective ground-based control mice (n=30) were isolated for in vitro experimentation. Vasoconstrictor responses were evoked in arteries via norepinephrine (NE), potassium chloride (KCl), and caffeine, and in veins through NE across a range of intraluminal pressures (2–12 cmH2O). Vasoconstriction to NE was also determined in mesenteric arteries at 1, 5, and 7 d postlanding. In arteries, maximal constriction to NE, KCl, and caffeine were reduced immediately following spaceflight and 1 d postflight. Spaceflight also reduced arterial ryanodine receptor-3 mRNA levels. In mesenteric veins, there was diminished constriction to NE after flight. The results indicate that the impaired vasoconstriction following spaceflight occurs through the ryanodine receptor-mediated intracellular Ca2+ release mechanism. Such vascular changes in astronauts could compromise the maintenance of arterial pressure during orthostatic stress.—Behnke, B. J., Stabley, J. N., McCullough, D. J., Davis, R. T., III, Dominguez, J. M., II, Muller-Delp, J. M., Delp, M. D. Effects of spaceflight and ground recovery on mesenteric artery and vein constrictor properties in mice.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Evidence indicates that cerebral blood flow is both increased and diminished in astronauts on return to Earth. Data from ground-based animal models simulating the effects of microgravity have shown that decrements in cerebral perfusion are associated with enhanced vasoconstriction and structural remodeling of cerebral arteries. Based on these results, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 13 d of spaceflight [Space Transportation System (STS)-135 shuttle mission] enhances myogenic vasoconstriction, increases medial wall thickness, and elicits no change in the mechanical properties of mouse cerebral arteries. Basilar and posterior communicating arteries (PCAs) were isolated from 9-wk-old female C57BL/6 mice for in vitro vascular and mechanical testing. Contrary to that hypothesized, myogenic vasoconstrictor responses were lower and vascular distensibility greater in arteries from spaceflight group (SF) mice (n=7) relative to ground-based control group (GC) mice (n=12). Basilar artery maximal diameter was greater in SF mice (SF: 236±9 μm and GC: 215±5 μm) with no difference in medial wall thickness (SF: 12.4±1.6 μm; GC: 12.2±1.2 μm). Stiffness of the PCA, as characterized via nanoindentation, was lower in SF mice (SF: 3.4±0.3 N/m; GC: 5.4±0.8 N/m). Collectively, spaceflight-induced reductions in myogenic vasoconstriction and stiffness and increases in maximal diameter of cerebral arteries signify that elevations in brain blood flow may occur during spaceflight. Such changes in cerebral vascular control of perfusion could contribute to increases in intracranial pressure and an associated impairment of visual acuity in astronauts during spaceflight.—Taylor, C.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight and prolonged bed rest induce deconditioning of the cardiovascular system and bone loss. Previous research has shown declines in femoral bone and marrow perfusion during unloading and with subsequent reloading in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) rats, an animal model of chronic disuse. We hypothesized that the attenuated bone and marrow perfusion may result from altered vasomotor properties of the bone resistance vasculature. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of unloading on the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties of the femoral principal nutrient artery (PNA), the main conduit for blood flow to the femur, in 2 wk HU and control (CON) rats. Vasoconstriction of the femoral PNA was assessed in vitro using norepinephrine, phenylephrine, clonidine, KCl, endothelin-1, arginine vasopressin, and myogenic responsiveness. Vasodilation through endothelium-dependent [acetylcholine, bradykinin, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD)] and endothelium-independent mechanisms [sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and adenosine] were also determined. Vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the PNA from HU rats was not enhanced through any of the mechanisms tested. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation to acetylcholine (CON, 86 ± 3%; HU, 48 ± 7% vasodilation) and FMD (CON, 61 ± 9%; HU, 11 ± 11% vasodilation) were attenuated in PNAs from HU rats, while responses to bradykinin were not different between groups. Endothelium-independent vasodilation to SNP and adenosine were not different between groups. These data indicate that unloading-induced decrements in bone and marrow perfusion and increases in vascular resistance are not the result of enhanced vasoconstrictor responsiveness of the bone resistance arteries but are associated with reductions in endothelium-dependent vasodilation.

PARÁGRAFO: Bone health and cardiovascular function are compromised in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of T2DM in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat. Responses of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) of the femur from obese ZDF rats with prediabetes, short-term diabetes, and long-term diabetes to endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) and –independent (sodium nitroprusside) vasodilation, and KCl, norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstrictor were determined in vitro. Few changes in the PNA vasomotor responses occurred in the pre-diabetic and short-term diabetic conditions. Endothelium-dependent and –independent vasodilation were reduced, and norepinephrine and myogenic vasoconstriction were enhanced in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes relative to lean age-matched controls. Differences in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA between ZDF rats and controls were abolished by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. The passive pressure-diameter response of the femoral PNA was also lower across a range of intraluminal pressures with long-term T2DM. Regional bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance, measured in vivo using radiolabeled microspheres, were lower in obese ZDF rats with long-term diabetes. These findings suggest that the profound impairment of the bone circulation may contribute to the osteopenia found to occur in long bones with chronic T2DM.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Conditions during spaceflight, such as the loss of the head-to-foot gravity vector, are thought to potentially alter cerebral blood flow and vascular resistance. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of long-term spaceflight on the functional, mechanical, and structural properties of cerebral arteries. Male C57BL/6N mice were flown 30 days in a Bion-M1 biosatellite. Basilar arteries isolated from spaceflight (SF) (n = 6), habitat control (HC) (n = 6), and vivarium control (VC) (n = 16) mice were used for in vitro functional and mechanical testing and histological structural analysis. The results demonstrate that vasoconstriction elicited through a voltage-gated Ca2+ mechanism (30–80 mM KCl) and thromboxane A2 receptors (10−8 − 3 × 10−5 M U46619) are lower in cerebral arteries from SF mice. Inhibition of Rho-kinase activity (1 μM Y27632) abolished group differences in U46619-evoked contractions. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation elicited by acetylcholine (10 μM, 2 μM U46619 preconstriction) was virtually absent in cerebral arteries from SF mice. The pressure-diameter relation was lower in arteries from SF mice relative to that in HC mice, which was not related to differences in the extracellular matrix protein elastin or collagen content or the elastin/collagen ratio in the basilar arteries. Diameter, medial wall thickness, and medial cross-sectional area of unpressurized basilar arteries were not different among groups. These results suggest that the microgravity-induced attenuation of both vasoconstrictor and vasodilator properties may limit the range of vascular control of cerebral perfusion or impair the distribution of brain blood flow during periods of stress.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth’s protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth’s magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4–5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Coronary microvascular function and blood flow responses during acute exercise are impaired in the aged heart but can be restored by exercise training. Coronary microvascular resistance is directly dependent on vascular smooth muscle function in coronary resistance arterioles; therefore, we hypothesized that age impairs contractile function and alters the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle in coronary arterioles. We further hypothesized that exercise training restores contractile function and reverses age-induced phenotypic alterations of arteriolar smooth muscle. Young and old Fischer 344 rats underwent 10 wk of treadmill exercise training or remained sedentary. At the end of training or cage confinement, contractile responses, vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and expression of contractile proteins were assessed in isolated coronary arterioles. Both receptor- and non-receptor-mediated contractile function were impaired in coronary arterioles from aged rats. Vascular smooth muscle shifted from a differentiated, contractile phenotype to a secretory phenotype with associated proliferation of smooth muscle in the arteriolar wall. Expression of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain 1 (SM1) was decreased in arterioles from aged rats, whereas expression of phospho-histone H3 and of the synthetic protein ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) were increased. Exercise training improved contractile responses, reduced smooth muscle proliferation and expression of rpS6, and increased expression of SM1 in arterioles from old rats. Thus age-induced contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and emergence of a secretory smooth muscle phenotype may contribute to impaired coronary blood flow responses, but arteriolar contractile responsiveness and a younger smooth muscle phenotype can be restored with late-life exercise training.
PARÁGRAFO: NEW & NOTEWORTHY Aging impairs contractile function of coronary arterioles and induces a shift of the vascular smooth muscle toward a proliferative, noncontractile phenotype. Late-life exercise training reverses contractile dysfunction of coronary arterioles and restores a young phenotype to the vascular smooth muscle.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Astronauts are reported to have experienced some impairment in visual acuity during their mission on the International Space Station (ISS) and after they returned to Earth. There is emerging evidence that changes in vision may involve alterations in ocular structure and function. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Nine-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (n = 12) were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX rocket to the ISS for a 35-day mission. The animals were housed in the mouse Habitat Cage Unit (HCU) in the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) “Kibo” facility on the ISS. The flight mice lived either under an ambient microgravity condition (µg) or in a centrifugal habitat unit that produced 1 g artificial gravity (µg + 1 g). Habitat control (HC) and vivarium control mice lived on Earth in HCUs or normal vivarium cages, respectively. Quantitative assessment of ocular tissue demonstrated that the µg group induced significant apoptosis in the retina vascular endothelial cells compared to all other groups (p < 0.05) that was 64% greater than that in the HC group. Proteomic analysis showed that many key pathways responsible for cell death, cell repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress were significantly altered in µg mice compared to HC animals. Additionally, there were more significant changes in regulated protein expression in the µg group relative to that in the µg + 1 g group. These data provide evidence that spaceflight induces retinal apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells and changes in retinal protein expression related to cellular structure, immune response and metabolic function, and that artificial gravity (AG) provides some protection against these changes. These retinal cellular responses may affect blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity, visual acuity, and impact the potential risk of developing late retinal degeneration.

PARÁGRAFO: Introduction: Mechanical forces and sympathetic influences are key determinants of vascular structure and function. This study tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading (HU) exerts diverse effects on forelimb and hindlimb small arteries of rats in functionally different regions of the skeletal muscle and skin.
PARÁGRAFO: Methods: Male Wistar rats were subjected to HU for 2 weeks, then skeletal muscle arteries (deep brachial and sural) and skin arteries (median and saphenous) were examined in vitro using wire myography or isobaric perfusion and glyoxylic acid staining.
PARÁGRAFO: Results: HU increased lumen diameter of both forelimb arteries but decreased diameter of the sural artery; the saphenous artery diameter was not affected. Following HU, maximal contractile responses to noradrenaline and serotonin increased in the forelimb but decreased in the hindlimb skeletal muscle feed arteries with no change in skin arteries; all region-specific alterations persisted after endothelium removal. HU increased the sensitivity to vasoconstrictors in the saphenous artery but not in the sural artery. In the saphenous artery, initially high sympathetic innervation density was reduced by HU, sparse innervation in the sural artery was not affected. Electrical stimulation of periarterial sympathetic nerves in isobarically perfused segments of the saphenous artery demonstrated a two-fold decrease of the contractile responses in HU rats compared to that of controls.
PARÁGRAFO: Conclusion: HU induces contrasting structural and functional adaptations in forelimb and hindlimb skeletal muscle arteries. Additionally, HU had diverse effects in two hindlimb vascular regions. Hyper-sensitivity of the saphenous artery to vasoconstrictors appears to result from the shortage of trophic sympathetic influence. Importantly, HU impaired sympathetically induced arterial vasoconstriction, consistent with the decreased sympathetic constrictor response in humans following space flight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Astronauts exhibit an assortment of clinical abnormalities in their eyes during long-duration spaceflight. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight induces epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming in the retina or alters the epigenetic clock. The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Several biological pathways involved in retinal diseases such as macular degeneration were significantly altered. Our results indicated that spaceflight decelerated the retinal epigenetic clock. This study demonstrates that spaceflight impacts the retina at the epigenomic and transcriptomic levels, and such changes could be involved in the etiology of eye-related disorders among astronauts.

Here we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E8. Calyceal terminal formation began at E10, however no mature calyces were observed until E12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. Calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells did not develop until E14. Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In all species studied, afferents from semicircular canals and otolith organs converge on central neurons in the brainstem. However, the spatial and temporal relationships between converging inputs and how these contribute to vestibular behaviors is not well understood. In the current study, we used discrete rotational and translational motion stimuli to characterize canal- and otolith-driven response components of convergent non-eye movement (NEM) neurons in the vestibular nuclear complex of alert pigeons. When compared to afferent responses, convergent canal signals had similar gain and phase ranges but exhibited greater spatial variability in their axes of preferred rotation. Convergent otolith signals also had similar mean gain and phase values to the afferent population but were spatially well-matched with the corresponding canal signals, cell-by-cell. However, neither response component alone nor a simple linear combination of these components was sufficient to predict actual net responses during combined canal-otolith stimulation. We discuss these findings in the context of previous studies of pigeon vestibular behaviors, and we compare our findings to similar studies in other species.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca2+ signaling through the L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function CaV1.2 mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the CaV1.2-dependent Ca2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The primary energy sources of mammalian cells are proteins, fats and sugars that are processed by well-known biochemical mechanisms that have been discovered and studied in 1G (terrestrial gravity). Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-μG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis 24 hours after exposure to sim-μG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after three days exposure of OLs to sim-μG confirmed increased the Krebs cycle (Krebs & Weitzman et al., 1987), flux in sim-μG. The secretome study also revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids such as, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67), lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity. Although longer chain lipids were not observed in this study, it is possible that at longer time points OLs would have continued moving forward toward the synthesis of lipids that constitute myelin. For centuries, basic developmental biology research has been the pillar to an array of discoveries that have led to clinical applications; we believe that studies using microgravity will open new avenues to our understanding of the brain in health and disease, in particular, to the discovery of new molecules and mechanisms impossible to unveil while in 1G.
PARÁGRAFO: This chart represents what is known about oligodendrocyte (OL) development in culture. Most studies have dealt with the synthesis of structural proteins and enzymes proper of the lineage as well as specific to developmental stages. Here we report a novel finding where membrane forming lipids were secreted by OL progenitors (OLP) exposed to weightlessness during 3 days, but not when OLPs were maintained in 1G. Examples of two lipids enriched in the secretome of these cells are shown.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Here we demonstrate that human neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate while in space and they express specific NSC markers after being in space. NSCs displayed both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells also kept their ability to become young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. Current injections elicited only an incipient action potential. No spontaneous synaptic events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes. Ascertaining the origin of the NSCs′ increased energy requirement is of the essence in order to design effective measures to minimize health risks associated with long-duration human spaceflight missions.

PARÁGRAFO: The authors wish to make the following corrections to Figure 10 of this paper [1]:
PARÁGRAFO: In the original publication, there is a mistake in the bar graph of Figure 10 as published.
PARÁGRAFO: At the moment of uploading the manuscript, we chose the wrong legend version. It should say Tf for transferrin (instead of Fer for ferritin, as published). The figure as is makes no sense because this section is about the two specific markers Tf and GPDH. Swapping the figure will correct the information without altering the data, contents or caption. The text and caption for the entire figure discuss transferrin (Tf) and the correct graph is pasted below.
PARÁGRAFO: Views of GC-OLPs (A–C) or SPC-OLPs (D–F) two weeks after being seeded. (A) Most GC-OLPs expressed Tf in their cytoplasm (inset and arrow). (B) They also co-expressed GPDH. (C) Merged view of both markers that colocalized. (D) Tf was expressed by all cells in their nuclei rather than the cytoplasm. (E) Most of these cells were weakly labeled for GPDH, and only those that had undergone karyokinesis or in the process of cytokinesis displayed nuclear GPDH expression. (F) Merged view of both markers. (G) This bar graph shows the percentage of the markers expressed alone or co-expressed by OLPs. In the GC group, 34% co-expressed both OL markers. Only 51% expressed transferrin alone, and 41% expressed GPDH only. In the case of SPC-OLPs, only 58% co-expressed Tf in the nucleus and cytoplasmic GPDH, although the GPDH expression was faint and it colocalized in the nucleus only in cells that had undergone karyokinesis and those that appeared to be undergoing cytokinesis. Only 2.2% of these OLPs expressed GPDH alone, indicative of their immature stage with respect to GC cells. The data are shown both in cell numbers and percentages. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA, in which p < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant (p < 0.01). An orthogonal image of the localization of Tf is shown in Supplemental Figure S4.
PARÁGRAFO: The authors state that the scientific conclusions are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Considering the imminence of long-term space travel, it is necessary to investigate the impact of space microgravity (SPC-µG) in order to determine if this environment has consequences on the astronauts’ health, in particular, neural and cognitive functions. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system (CNS) cell populations and learning how weightlessness impacts NSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders. In previous studies, we found that exposure to SPC-µG resulted in enhanced proliferation, a shortened cell cycle, and a larger cell diameter of NSCs compared to control cells. Here, we report the frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD) including incomplete cell division (ICD), where cytokinesis is not successfully completed, and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD) of NSCs following SPC-µG as well as secretome exposure compared to ground control (1G) NSCs. These findings provide new insights into the potential health implications of space travel and have far-reaching implications for understanding the mechanisms leading to the deleterious effects of long-term space travel as well as potential carcinogenic susceptibility. Knowledge of these mechanisms could help to develop preventive or corrective measures for successful long-term SPC-µG exposure.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the consequences of long-term space missions. Here we examined the behavior of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) after space flight using time-lapse microscopy. We show that most OLPs divided more than ground control (GC) counterparts did. Nonetheless, a subpopulation of OLPs flown to space presented a significant increase in autophagic cell death. Examination of the proteomic profile of the secretome of space flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) revealed that the stress protein heat shock protein-90 beta “HSP-90β” was the 5th most enriched (6.8 times) and the secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine “SPARC” was the 7th most enriched (5.2 times), with respect to ground control cells. SPARC induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, which leads to autophagy. Given the roles and importance of these two proteins in mammalian cells’ metabolism, their upregulation may hold the key to modulating cell proliferation and autophagy, in order to mitigate ICP and VIIP during and after space missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment intracranial pressure (VIIP) are some of the sequels of long-term space missions. Here we sought to determine how space microgravity (µG) impacts the metabolomics profile of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), the myelin-forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased glutamate and energy metabolism while the OLPs were in space for 26 days. We also show that after space flight, OLPs (SPC OLPs) display significantly increased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. These data are in agreement with our previous work using simulated microgravity. In addition, our global metabolomics approach allowed for the discovery of endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs while in space that are significantly modulated by microgravity. Our results provide, for the first time, relevant information about the energetic state of OLPs while in space and after space flight. The functional and molecular relevance of these specific pathways are promising targets for therapeutic intervention for humans in long-term space missions to the moon, Mars and beyond.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The change in gravitational force has a significant effect on biological tissues and the entire organism. As with any alteration in the environment, microgravity (µG) produces modifications in the system inducing adaptation to the new condition. In this study, we analyzed the effect of µG on neural stem cells (NSCs) following a space flight to the International Space Station (ISS). After 3 days in space, analysis of the metabolome in culture medium revealed increased glycolysis with augmented pyruvate and glycerate levels, and activated catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glutamine. NSCs flown into space (SPC-NSCs) also showed increased synthesis of NADH and formation of polyamine spermidine when compared to ground controls (GC-NSCs). Overall, the space environment appears to increase energy demands in response to the µG setting.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Space exploration objectives will soon move from low Earth orbit to distant destinations like Moon and Mars. The present work provides an up-to-date roadmap that identifies critical research gaps related to human behavior and performance in altered gravity and space. The roadmap summarizes (1) key neurobehavioral challenges associated with spaceflight, (2) the need to consider sex as a biological variable, (3) the use of integrative omics technologies to elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in the brain and behavior, and (4) the importance of understanding the neural representation of gravity throughout the brain and its multisensory processing. We then highlight the need for a variety of target-specific countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system and performance. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs and stress the importance of new collaborative strategies across agencies and researchers for fostering an integrative cross- and transdisciplinary approach from cells, molecules to neural circuits and cognitive performance. Finally, we highlight that space research in neurocognitive science goes beyond monitoring and mitigating risks in astronauts but could also have significant benefits for the population on Earth.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Life in spaceflight demonstrates remarkable acclimation processes within the specialized habitats of vehicles subjected to the myriad of unique environmental issues associated with orbital trajectories. To examine the response processes that occur in plants in space, leaves and roots from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedlings from three GFP reporter lines that were grown from seed for 12 days on the International Space Station and preserved on orbit in RNAlater were returned to Earth and analyzed by using iTRAQ broad-scale proteomics procedures. Using stringent criteria, we identified over 1500 proteins, which included 1167 leaf proteins and 1150 root proteins we were able to accurately quantify. Quantification revealed 256 leaf proteins and 358 root proteins that showed statistically significant differential abundance in the spaceflight samples compared to ground controls, with few proteins differentially regulated in common between leaves and roots. This indicates that there are measurable proteomics responses to spaceflight and that the responses are organ-specific. These proteomics data were compared with transcriptome data from similar spaceflight samples, showing that there is a positive but limited relationship between transcriptome and proteome regulation of the overall spaceflight responses of plants. These results are discussed in terms of emergence understanding of plant responses to spaceflight particularly with regard to cell wall remodeling, as well as in the context of deriving multiple omics data sets from a single on-orbit preservation and operations approach.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Our primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in primary roots. Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In this article we report the identification of T-DNA (transfer DNA) insertion sites within two different gene regions in the genome of an Arabidopsis mutant line, SALK_084889. The T-DNA positions are in the 3′ UTR (untranslated region) of DREB2A (Dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 2A) (AT5G05410) and promoter of LOX1 (Lipoxygenase 1) (AT1G55020) as determined by DNA-PCR and sanger sequencing. The expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 were also analyzed using quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) in SALK_084889 and wild type Arabidopsis (Col, Columbia). Further, the comparison of drought and heat tolerance between Col and SALK_084889 were conducted by stress treatments. The present data indicate that in SALK_084889, the expression of DREB2A is not downregulated under normal growth conditions but can be affected only in roots under drought treatment, while LOX1 is significantly downregulated in both roots and shoots under all tested conditions. These data are original and have not been published elsewhere.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.

PARÁGRAFO: In this article we report the identification of a homozygous lethal T-DNA (transfer DNA) line within the coding region of the At1G05290 gene in the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) line, SALK_063500. The T-DNA insertion is found within exon one of the AT1G05290 gene, however a homozygous T-DNA allele is unattainable. In the heterozygous T-DNA allele the expression levels of AT1G05290 were compared to wild type Arabidopsis (Col-0, Columbia). Further analyses revealed an aberrant silique phenotype found in the heterozygous SALK_063500 plants that is attributed to the reduced rate of pollen tube germination. These data are original and have not been published elsewhere.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Plants grown in spaceflight experience novel environmental signals, including those associated with microgravity and ionizing radiation. Spaceflight triggers a response involving transcriptional re-programming and altered cell morphology, though many aspects of this response remain uncharacterized. We analyzed the spaceflight-induced transcriptome with a focus on genes that undergo alternative splicing to examine differential splicing associated with spaceflight—an unstudied characteristic of the molecular response to spaceflight exposure. RNA sequence data obtained during the APEX03 spaceflight experiment that was collected from two Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes at two seedling stages grown onboard the International Space Station, or as ground controls at Kennedy Space Center, were re-examined to detect alternative splicing differences induced by spaceflight. Presence/absence variation analysis was used to identify putative expression-level differences in alternatively spliced isoforms between spaceflight and ground controls and was followed by analysis of significant differential alternative splicing. This study provides the first evidence of a role for alternative splicing in the molecular processes of physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The EDEN ISS greenhouse is a space-analog test facility near the German Neumayer III station in Antarctica. The facility is part of the project of the same name and was designed and built starting from March 2015 and eventually deployed in Antarctica in January 2018. The nominal operation of the greenhouse started on February 7th and continued until the 20th of November. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. Research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted. Part of the latter is the determination of the biomass production of the different crops. The data on this topic is presented in this paper. During the first season 26 different crops were grown on the 12.5 m2 cultivation area of the greenhouse. A large number of crops were grown continuously throughout the 9 months of operation, but there were also crops that were only grown a few times for test purposes. The focus of this season was on growing lettuce, leafy greens and fresh vegetables. In total more than 268 kg of edible biomass was produced by the EDEN ISS greenhouse facility in 2018. Most of the harvest was cucumbers (67 kg), lettuces (56 kg), leafy greens (49 kg), and tomatoes (50 kg) complemented with smaller amounts of herbs (12 kg), radish (8 kg), and kohlrabi (19 kg). The environmental set points for the crops were 330–600 μmol/(m2*s) LED light, 21°C, ∼65% relative humidity, 1000 ppm and the photoperiod was 17 h per day. The overall yearly productivity of the EDEN ISS greenhouse in 2018 was 27.4 kg/m2, which is equal to 0.075 kg/(m2*d). This paper shows in detail the data on edible and inedible biomass production of each crop grown in the EDEN ISS greenhouse in Antarctica during the 2018 season.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The observation that plant roots skew in microgravity recently refuted the long-held conviction that skewing was a gravity-dependent phenomenon. Further, spaceflight root skewing suggests that specific root morphologies and cell wall remodeling systems may be important aspects of spaceflight physiological adaptation. However, connections between skewing, cell wall modification and spaceflight physiology are currently based on inferences rather than direct tests. Therefore, the Advanced Plant Experiments-03-2 (APEX-03-2) spaceflight study was designed to elucidate the contribution of two skewing- and cell wall-associated genes in Arabidopsis to root behavior and gene expression patterns in spaceflight, to assess whether interruptions of different skewing pathways affect the overall spaceflight-associated process. SPIRAL1 is a skewing-related protein implicated in directional cell expansion, and functions by regulating cortical microtubule dynamics. SKU5 is skewing-related glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein of the plasma membrane and cell wall implicated in stress response signaling. These two genes function in different cellular pathways that affect skewing on the Earth, and enable a test of the relevance of skewing pathways to spaceflight physiological adaptation. In this study, both sku5 and spr1 mutants showed different skewing behavior and markedly different patterns of gene expression in the spaceflight environment. The spr1 mutant showed fewer differentially expressed genes than its Col-0 wild-type, whereas sku5 showed considerably more than its WS wild-type. Developmental age played a substantial role in spaceflight acclimation in all genotypes, but particularly in sku5 plants, where spaceflight 4d seedlings had almost 10-times as many highly differentially expressed genes as the 8d seedlings. These differences demonstrated that the two skewing pathways represented by SKU5 and SPR1 have unique and opposite contributions to physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The spr1 response is less intense than wild type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the intensity of the sku5 responses suggests that the loss of SKU5 initiates a much more complex, deeper and more stress related response to spaceflight. This suggests that proper SKU5 function is important to spaceflight adaptation.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The effects of spaceflight on cartilaginous structure are largely unknown. To address this deficiency, articular cartilage (AC) and sternal cartilage (SC) from mice exposed to 30 days of microgravity on the BION-M1 craft were investigated for pathological changes. The flight AC showed some evidence of degradation at the tissue level with loss of proteoglycan staining and a reduction in mRNA expression of mechano-responsive and structural cartilage matrix proteins compared to non-flight controls. These data suggest that degradative changes are underway in the AC extracellular matrix exposed to microgravity. In contrast, there was no evidence of cartilage breakdown in SC flight samples and the gene expression profile was distinct from that of AC with a reduction in metalloproteinase gene transcription. Since the two cartilages respond differently to microgravity we propose that each is tuned to the biomechanical environments in which they are normally maintained. That is, the differences between magnitude of normal terrestrial loading and the unloading of microgravity dictates the tissue response. Weight-bearing articular cartilage, but not minimally loaded sternal fibrocartilage, is negatively affected by the unloading of microgravity. We speculate that the maintenance of physiological loading on AC during spaceflight will minimize AC damage.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight imposes several unique stresses on biological life that together can have a profound impact on the homeostasis between eukaryotes and their associated microbes. One such stressor, microgravity, has been shown to alter host-microbe interactions at the genetic and physiological levels. Recent sequencing of the microbiomes associated with plants and animals have shown that these interactions are essential for maintaining host health through the regulation of several metabolic and immune responses. Disruptions to various environmental parameters or community characteristics may impact the resiliency of the microbiome, thus potentially driving host-microbe associations towards disease. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of host-microbe interactions in microgravity and assess the impact of this unique environmental stress on the normal physiological and genetic responses of both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. As humans move beyond our biosphere and undergo longer duration space flights, it will be essential to more fully understand microbial fitness in microgravity conditions in order to maintain a healthy homeostasis between humans, plants and their respective microbiomes.

PARÁGRAFO: Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border. The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts. Manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.
PARÁGRAFO: Perhaps, the most common type of animal symbiosis, whether pathogenic, commensal or mutualistic, is the interaction of microbial cells along the apical surfaces of polarized host epithelia (for reviews, see Fraune and Bosch, 2010; Hooper, 2015). At these interfaces, the partners influence one another’s form and function. For example, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) efface the brush border and hijack the cytoskeletal proteins of the epithelia to create features that promote pathogenesis (Celli et al., 2000). The microbiota of both invertebrates and vertebrates can induce an increase in the density of microvilli (Cerezuela et al., 2012; Chichlowski et al., 2007; Kuhlwein et al., 2013; Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Ringø et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2012) and, reciprocally, microvillus-derived vesicles of the brush border help to communicate with and control bacterial populations (Shifrin et al., 2012). In addition, it has long been known that epithelial tissues associated with microbes, such as the gut, are on profound daily rhythms. Only recently, however, has it been demonstrated that the microbial partners play a role in the control of these rhythms (Heath-Heckman et al., 2013; Leone et al., 2015; Rosselot et al., 2016; Wier et al., 2010), but the extent to which daily rhythms affect the microarchitecture of the brush border has not been characterized.
PARÁGRAFO: The Euprymna scolopes-Vibrio fischeri symbiosis offers an opportunity to explore how and when symbiont-induced changes of the brush border are induced in early development and how they interface with the daily rhythms of the symbiosis. Early studies of the association demonstrated that colonization of the host animal induces ultrastructural changes in the epithelial cells of crypts where symbionts take up residence. The epithelium of the newly hatched juvenile host begins as a simple, columnar epithelial layer with sparse microvilli (Fig. S1A). Upon symbiont colonization, these epithelial cells increase in volume fourfold to take on a cuboidal morphology (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1994; Visick et al., 2000). In addition, the density and complexity of microvilli increases such that symbiont cells, while remaining extracellular, become surrounded by host membranes (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Fig. S1A). These observed changes were derived from data taken at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h following colonization, i.e., at times that would not capture daily rhythms.
PARÁGRAFO: Concomitant with these studies of the juvenile, it was discovered that the symbiosis in adults has a daily rhythm; animals expel ~95% of their symbionts into the surrounding seawater each day around dawn (Graf and Ruby, 1998; Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 1998). A recent study of the adult transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrated that host cytoskeletal genes are highly regulated in the hours around dawn (Wier et al., 2010). These changes in gene expression correlate with a blebbing off of the microvilli of the crypt epithelial brush border, not unlike that observed in EPEC pathogenesis; this effacement is followed by a re-formation of the microvillous brush border (Fig. S1B). A subsequent study of the system revealed that the symbionts control transcriptional regulation of clock genes of a peripheral circadian rhythm specific to the light organ (Heath-Heckman et al., 2013). Taken together, these data showed that the squid-vibrio symbiosis displays a profound daily rhythm.
PARÁGRAFO: Whether the daily changes in the adult brush border occur in juveniles, and how such changes interface with symbiont-induced development of the juvenile crypt epithelia, have not been characterized. In addition, while it is known that increase in crypt cell volume requires symbiont light production (Visick et al., 2000), the feature(s) of the symbiont that trigger(s) brush-border remodelling has remained unknown. This study was undertaken to address these questions. The data show that the remodelling of the crypt brush borders begins in juvenile animals and this activity requires influences from both an environmental light cue and interaction with the microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) of symbiont cells.
PARÁGRAFO: Previous studies showed that the phenomenon of daily venting of symbionts by adult E. scolopes depends on an exogenous ‘dawn’ light cue, i.e., onset of light in animals entrained to a 12:12 light/dark (L/D) cycle (Graf and Ruby, 1998; Nyholm and McFall-Ngai, 1998). However, the timing of venting relative to exposure of the animal to light had not been resolved, data that are critical to further analyses of brush-border dynamics. Thus, we designed experiments to observe and manipulate venting in the juvenile squid, which also display venting behaviour, but are more experimentally manipulable. In these assays, individual animals were maintained in vials, but removed from these vials at time points before and after a light cue to measure the presence or absence of V. fischeri luminescence in the water. As in adult animals, symbiont venting in juveniles maintained on a 12:12 L/D cycle occurred following the light cue of dawn (Fig. 1). As the symbionts were vented, luminescence increased and peaked by ~2 h after the cue. This peak was followed by a decline in the amount of luminescence to undetectable levels by ~6 h post onset of environmental light, because of the loss of luminescence activity that results from absence of nutrients to the expelled symbionts (Lee and Ruby, 1994). However, animals entrained on a 12:12 L/D cycle and then exposed to a delayed dawn of up to 10 h did not show venting until after the delayed light cue was presented, i.e., dependence on a light cue persisted for several hours after the entrained dawn; however, after 10 h without a light cue, the animals begin to vent spontaneously (Fig. S2). These data demonstrated that the venting behaviour is not on an entrained circadian rhythm and that the timing of the cue can be experimentally manipulated independent of circadian behaviours for up to 10 h.
PARÁGRAFO: Natural venting behaviour. Animals were entrained on a 12:12 light/dark regime, and luminescence of vented Vibrio fischeri was measured in the surrounding water before and after the dawn light cue. Data shown are from one representative experiment. First and peak luminescence occur between ~0.5 and 2.5 h following the cue. RLU, relative light units.
PARÁGRAFO: We first examined whether effacement of the crypt epithelial brush border occurs in the juvenile as it does in the adult (Wier et al., 2010) and, if so, whether the process is associated with venting, i.e., affected by the time and influenced by symbiotic state of the animal. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we quantified microvilli along epithelial apical surfaces (Fig. 2A – C). All experiments were performed with animals at 24 h post inoculation or longer, when the light organ is fully colonized and daily rhythms are reliably occurring. Effacement was detected as soon as 5 min after the dawn cue at 36 h post-hatching. Microvillar density at this time was 55–65% of that observed at 24 h post-hatching, or at ‘dusk’ of the first day (Fig. 2D); maximal microvillar density also occurs around dusk in light organs of adult animals (Wier et al., 2010). By 38 h post-hatching, or ~2 h after the light cue, the microvillar density had decreased to 25–35% of that at dusk (Fig. 2D). Both symbiotic (Sym) and aposymbiotic (Apo) animals showed a similar, significant decrease in microvillar density in response to the dawn cue (34–36 h P < 0.001 for Sym and Apo), indicating that the effacement was not dependent upon colonization state. In addition, the effacement was localized to the microvilli and did not extend into the crypt epithelial cells (Fig. 2E), as was seen previously in adult squid (Wier et al., 2010). These data demonstrate that effacement occurs in juvenile animals and is independent of symbiotic state.

Black (darkness)/white (light) bar above the graph, light field experienced by the juvenile animals. Microvillar density was normalized to the 24 h time point for both the Apo and Sym conditions. n = three biological replicates (separate animals) and seven technical replicates per condition (different regions within crypt 1). Error bars, standard error of the mean.
PARÁGRAFO: E. Representative transmission electron microscopy images of fields measured for the 34 (2 h before light cue) and 38 h (2 h after light cue) conditions in (D).
PARÁGRAFO: Because effacement began soon after the dawn light cue, we then sought to determine whether a dawn cue serves as a stimulus for the effacement of crypt-cell microvilli. We presented juvenile animals with a light cue 6 h before their anticipated dawn, at normal dawn, or 6 h after their normal dawn, and then measured the microvillar density 2 h before, 5 min after and 2 h after these light cues for all three conditions. The crypt-cell microvilli significantly decreased in number beginning 5 min after the light cue independent of whether the cue was given early, at normal dawn, or after normal dawn (Fig. 3). However, the decrease occurred slightly more slowly in animals presented an early light cue as shown by a significant decrease in microvillar density between 0 and 2 h after the light cue in the animals given an early light cue (P < 0.05), but not in those given light cues at normal dawn or after normal dawn (Fig. 3; 6 h early/late), suggesting that the nadir in microvillar density was reached more quickly in those animals presented with a normal or late light cue. These data provide evidence that effacement is triggered by an exogenous light cue.
PARÁGRAFO: The effect of light-cue manipulation on crypt-cell microvillar density of symbiotic juvenile animals. Light cues were given to cohorts of animals 6 h before normal dawn (left), at normal dawn (middle), or 6 h after normal dawn (right). Within each cohort, microvillar density was measured 2 h before (−2), at (0), or 2 h after (2) the light cue. For each set, the data were normalized to the −2 h condition, although all statistics were performed on the raw data, which were then transformed. n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition; Error bars, standard error of the mean; * = P < 0.05, ** = P < 0.01, *** = P < 0.001 by an analysis of variance with a Tukey’s pairwise comparison.
PARÁGRAFO: While effacement of the crypt-cell microvilli was not symbiosis dependent, previous data showed that microvillar density of the crypt epithelia increases each day following the onset of symbiosis (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998). To investigate this change with symbiosis, we compared density of microvilli in aposymbiotic and symbiotic animals at 38, 40 and 42 h, i.e., 2, 4 and 6 h following venting at 36 h post colonization. Regrowth of the microvilli following effacement occurred ~3× faster in symbiotic animals than in aposymbiotic animals (average =86 mv/25 µm2 h−1 ± 10 vs 31 mv/25 µm2 h−1 ± 4.6 respectively) with symbiotic animals reaching a microvillar density more than twice that of their aposymbiotic counterparts (Fig. 4A).
PARÁGRAFO: The influence of symbiosis on microvillar regrowth.
PARÁGRAFO: A. Quantification of microvillar density in aposymbiotic (Apo) and wild-type (WT) colonized juvenile squid at 38, 40 and 42 h after hatching.
PARÁGRAFO: B. Microvillar density and cellular width of the crypt epithelium in animals at 48 h post-hatching colonized with WT, a mutant defective in luminescence (Δlux), a lysine auxotroph (lysA) or left uncolonized (Apo). a, b – groups of statistically similar means using a significance level of P < 0.001 by an analysis of variance followed by a Tukey’s pairwise comparison performed on the raw data. Error bars, standard error of the mean; n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition.
PARÁGRAFO: To determine whether colonization level or symbiont luminescence is critical for the symbiosis-induced change in microvillar density, we compared density along the brush borders of animals colonized with wild-type V. fischeri to those colonized by the non-luminescent strain (Δlux) and the lysine auxotroph (lysA), both of which exhibit a symbiont colonization level approximately 10% of wild-type V. fischeri at 24–48 h post inoculation (Bose et al., 2008; Whistler et al., 2007). Microvillar densities induced by these mutant strains were statistically indistinguishable from each other and from wild type; all strains were 50–75% higher than that of aposymbiotic animals (Fig. 4B; upper, P < 0.001). These data suggest that the induction of symbiont-mediated microvillar growth is not dependent upon bacterial density or bacterial light. Symbionts also induce a fourfold increase in volume of host crypt epithelial cells, which is light dependent, but not dependent on colonization level (Visick et al., 2000). Both the Δlux-colonized and the aposymbiotic animals showed this significantly smaller cell width as compared with wild type and lysA-colonized animals (Fig. 4B; lower P < 0.001), demonstrating that the symbiosis-mediated increase in microvillar density was not coupled to the cell swelling phenotype.
PARÁGRAFO: Because symbiont MAMPs, particularly the peptidoglycan monomer (also known as ‘tracheal cytotoxin’ or TCT) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induce several host developmental phenotypes in the squid-vibrio symbiosis (for review, see McFall-Ngai et al., 2010), we compared the change in microvillar density in animals exposed to wild-type symbionts with those exposed to V. fischeri MAMPs. Either LPS alone or LPS and TCT combined induced microvillar densities that were statistically indistinguishable from symbiotic animals. However, TCT-treated animals exhibited a microvillar density of about 75% relative to animals colonized by wild-type V. fischeri (P < 0.05). Thus, while TCT has some effect, the data demonstrate that LPS alone can induce the increases in microvillar density observed in the juvenile squid (Fig. 5A).

Colonization by either WT or the waaL mutant resulted in microvillar densities significantly greater than that of aposymbiotic animals (middle, P < 0.001). Brush borders of animals colonized with WT V. fischeri or exposed to LPS treated with heat-inactivated alkaline phosphatase (LPS + hi-AP) showed no significant difference in microvillar density (right); these groups showed significantly greater microvillar density than animals exposed to LPS treated with active AP (LPS + AP) or those left uncolonized (Apo) (P < 0.001). a, b, c – denotes groups with statistically similar means using a significance level of P < 0.05 by an analysis of variance followed by a Tukey’s pairwise comparison performed on the raw data. Error bars, standard error of the mean; n = three biological replicates and seven technical replicates per condition.
PARÁGRAFO: To define the physical relationship of the crypt epithelial cells to symbiont LPS, we performed electron-microscopy immunocytochemistry using a polyclonal antibody generated to V. fischeri LPS. Cross-reactivity of the antibody to LPS localized to the outer envelope of colonized V. fischeri cells, the host crypt lumen, and inside of the host epithelial cells (Fig. 5B), providing several possible locations for interactions of host receptors with the LPS ligand.
PARÁGRAFO: Different portions of the V. fischeri LPS molecule, including the phosphate groups, acyl chains and the O-antigen, have been implicated in the various developmental phenotypes of the host squid (Altura et al., 2011; Post et al., 2012; Rader et al., 2012) (Fig. 5C). Thus, we conducted experiments aimed at defining the active portion of the LPS molecule that induces an increase in microvillar density along the crypt brush border of juvenile animals. To determine whether the O-antigen moiety of LPS is active in this process, we colonized juvenile squid with a mutant lacking the O-antigen (waaL) and compared the microvillar density in those animals at 48 h with that in animals colonized with wild-type (WT) V. fischeri and animals left uncolonized (Apo) (Fig. 5C). Microvillar density did not differ significantly between the WT and waaL-colonized animals (Fig. 5C), suggesting that the O-antigen does not play a role in the induction of the process.
PARÁGRAFO: To determine whether phosphorylation of the lipid A is necessary for the induction of microvillar growth in the light organ, we treated the LPS with alkaline phosphatase (AP) or with heat-inactivated AP as a control (Fig. 5C). We then exposed juvenile animals to both LPS preparations and compared the microvillar densities of treated animals with those of animals colonized with WT V. fischeri and those left aposymbiotic. Microvillar density was significantly lower in aposymbiotic animals and those exposed to AP-treated LPS relative to animals colonized with the WT strain and those exposed to LPS treated with heat-inactivated AP. However, the microvillar density of animals exposed to AP-treated LPS was slightly but significantly higher than that of aposymbiotic animals (P<0.05), suggesting that either not all of the phosphate groups were cleaved from the LPS molecule during AP treatment or that another portion of the V. fischeri LPS molecule works together with the phosphorylated lipid A to affect host crypt-cell microvillar density.
PARÁGRAFO: The results of this study on the squid-vibrio symbiosis, which exploited the capability to manipulate juvenile animals experimentally, provide evidence that (i) effacement of the brush border occurs daily around dawn in juveniles and persists throughout the life time of the host; (ii) the trigger for this effacement is the light cue of dawn and is independent of symbiosis; (iii) the monotonic increase in microvillar density at dawn in juveniles requires V. fischeri colonization, but is not dependent on level of colonization or luminescence capacity of the symbionts; and (iv) this increase in density is induced by phosphorylated lipid A. These data, when integrated with past contributions, provide a new model for the diurnal and developmental dynamics of the crypt brush border in the squid-vibrio symbiosis.
PARÁGRAFO: Whereas in pathogenic associations, such as EPEC, colonization induces a single, terminal effacement of the microvilli, effacement is independent of the symbionts in the squid-vibrio symbiosis. Instead, evidence presented here suggests that the brush border effacement of the squid light organ, which is embryonically gut derived (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1993), requires a light cue. Circadian rhythms, which are principally entrained by light cues, control numerous cellular processes of the mammalian gut (Froy, 2011), although, to our knowledge, the influences of rhythms on brush-border ultrastructure and cues that might mediate any such changes have not been reported. However, the light-cued central clock of the brain entrains the peripheral clock that, in turn, regulates epithelial function of the intestine (Pacha and Sumova, 2013). As such, analysis of the mammalian intestinal epithelium for changes in the brush-border microarchitecture in response to environmental light cues, independent of the microbiota, may be a fruitful research avenue.
PARÁGRAFO: The daily effacement of the brush border may not be a ‘hard-wired’ feature associated with evolutionary selection on symbiosis in the squid-vibrio system, but instead may be related to convergence of the light organ with the eye. Several studies have focused on the structural and functional similarities of these organs. Although the eye is photoreceptive and the light organ is photogenic, they have similar accessory tissues to modify light (Crookes et al., 2004; Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1992), as well as similar biochemistry and developmental induction (Peyer et al., 2014; Tong et al., 2009). Relevant here is that the shedding of microvilli in response to light is common in the rhabdomeric photoreceptors that are characteristic of certain invertebrate eyes, including those of cephalopods (Battelle, 2013; Gray et al., 2008; Stark et al., 1988). The renewal of portions of photoreceptors is common in both invertebrate and vertebrate eyes as a response to the photo-oxidative reactions that can ultimately lead to retinal degeneration (Jinks et al., 1998; Strauss, 2005). The behaviour shedding of the microvilli in rhabdomeric eyes thus serves to renew the microvilli of the retinal cells each day. As with other characters of the light organ that appear to be co-opted from the eye, effacement behaviour may serve a similar function, i.e., to renew the host’s cellular interface with the bacterial partner on a daily basis in response to oxidative stress imposed by the symbiosis (Ruby and McFall-Ngai, 1999).
PARÁGRAFO: Although the effacement behaviour of the crypt brush border of juveniles does not require the interaction with symbionts, we cannot rule out a role for triggering this behaviour in the light organ of mature animals. Recent studies of the system have demonstrated that the organ undergoes maturation over the first few weeks of the symbiosis, which results in a dramatic change in its biochemistry. Notably, at ~4 weeks, a rhythm of symbiont metabolism ensues that correlates with a daily acidification and a change in the oxygen availability in the crypts (Schwartzman et al., 2015). Whereas the relative anatomical and biochemical simplicity of the juvenile organ revealed the lack of a role of the symbiont in effacement, the complexity of the adult organ renders such a determination challenging, if not impossible.
PARÁGRAFO: The form and function of the terminal web of polarized epithelia is a principal target of bacterial symbionts, a phenomenon that has been best studied in pathogens. In many cases, bacterial alterations of the brush border result in a more intimate association of the bacterial cells with host cell membranes, similar to what has been observed in early colonization of the squid-host crypts by V. fischeri (Fig. S1). For example, the attaching and effacing activity of EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli is followed by a complex set of events in which the pathogen hijacks the host cytoskeleton to produce ‘pedestals’ at the site of attachment that cradle the pathogen (DeVinney et al., 2001; Gruber and Sperandio, 2014; Gruenheid et al., 2001) and promote pathogenesis (Aroeti et al., 2012). More subtle effects occur with the early colonization of nasopharyngeal epithelia by Neisseria meningitidis; following attachment to the epithelium, this opportunistic pathogen recruits host cytoskeletal proteins to induce elongation of the brush-border microvilli (Higashi et al., 2009; Stephens et al., 1983). Although these phenomena have been studied for decades in pathogens, new data demonstrate that normal colonization by the microbiota can also affect the brush border; manipulation of the microbiota diversity and abundance by antibiotics and probiotics can influence the density of intestinal-cell epithelia (Cerezuela et al., 2012; Chichlowski et al., 2007; Kuhlwein et al., 2013; Ringø et al., 2007; Shukla et al., 2012).
PARÁGRAFO: Both biochemical and biophysical features of bacteria have been implicated in induction of brush-border remodelling. Several bacterial pathogens, such as EPEC, use type III secretion systems to introduce effector molecules directly into host-cell cytoplasm (Coburn et al., 2007). In a study of N. meningitidis pathogenesis, the biophysical force exerted by type IV pili was implicated in driving the elongation of the microvilli (Higashi et al., 2009), but the precise mechanism of this action was not determined. A recent study of EPEC, which also requires type IV pili for virulence, has shown that the influence of the biophysical forces exerted by the pili is likely indirect (Aroeti et al., 2012). The data provide evidence that the pili serve simply to draw the pathogen closer to the host cell membranes, which promotes the opportunity for full virulence of the type III secretion system. Such phenomena may occur in the squid-vibrio system, wherein presentation of lipid A requires interaction of host cells with symbiont pili; V. fischeri encodes eight type IV pili (Ruby et al., 2005) that may function individually or in combination to facilitate signalling and colonization (Stabb and Ruby, 2003).
PARÁGRAFO: Although MAMPs, including LPS (e.g., Isowa et al., 1999; Gutiérrez-Venegas et al., 2008; Kleveta et al., 2012), have been shown to perturb the cytoskeletal network of host cells, they have not been implicated directly in remodelling of the brush border. The observation that phosphorylated lipid A is required for the developmental increase in brush-border microvillar density adds to a long list of MAMP-induced developmental phenotypes in the host squid (McFall-Ngai et al., 2010). Lipid A works in synergy with the peptidoglycan monomer to induce apoptosis and morphogenesis of the superficial ciliated epithelium that potentiates colonization (Koropatnick et al., 2004).
PARÁGRAFO: We have determined that symbiont MAMPs are inducers of many host-squid developmental phenotypes, but much work remains to be carried out to elucidate how the MAMPs are delivered to and recognized by host cells. A recent study of the system demonstrated that outer membrane vesicles contain MAMPs and that host cells take up these vesicles (Aschtgen et al., 2015). The molecular basis of how these outer membrane vesicles signal to the host may be through the light-organ pattern-recognition receptors. The light organ expresses numerous pattern-recognition receptors (McFall-Ngai et al., 2010). One of these, a LPS binding protein, EsLBP1, binds V. fischeri LPS, and the gene that encodes for this protein is upregulated about 20-fold in the crypt spaces in response to peptidoglycan derivatives, and not LPS, of the colonizing symbiont (Krasity et al., 2015). The role that this LPS ligand plays in the induction of LPS-mediated changes in the host brush border remains to be determined.
PARÁGRAFO: We have not defined here how lipid A mediates these changes in the crypt brush border, but we have established a link to the daily rhythms of these tissues. These data complement another recent study of the system, which demonstrated a daily regulation of host AP activity (Rader et al., 2012). Several contributions report that the activity of secreted host AP dephosphorylates, and thus ‘detoxifies’, lipid A in symbiotic systems, including the squid-vibrio association and the intestinal-microbiota symbioses of the vertebrate gut (Bates et al., 2007). AP activity fluctuates over the day–night cycle in both juveniles and adults, being highest mid-day, and low around the time of effacement (Fig. 6A). These data would suggest that phosphorylated lipid A delivers the signal for microvilli regrowth around dawn. Studies of the host transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrate that genes encoding host cytoskeletal proteins are upregulated in the hours before dawn (Wier et al., 2010), suggesting that the tissues are biochemically primed for the lipid A signal of the symbiont. Finally, in recent studies of both pathogens and members of the microbiota, the dephosphylation of their lipid A renders them more resistant to the activity of antimicrobial peptides (Cullen et al., 2015; Herrera et al., 2014), a consequence that may also occur in the squid-vibrio symbiosis.
PARÁGRAFO: Model for crypt brush border dynamics in early development through maturation of the light organ.
PARÁGRAFO: A. Early development. Unlike the monotonic increase first suggested by an earlier study (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998), analysis of the system over the day–night cycle predicts effacement and regrowth each day over the first several days in both aposymbiotic (Apo, red lines) and symbiotic (Sym, blue lines) animals. In the symbiotic animals, the regrowth includes an increase in microvillar density. Incorporating data from a study of AP activity show that it remains low in aposymbiotic (Apo, red bars) animals and is low in symbiotic animals around dawn, but is high in symbiotic animals (Sym, blue bars) mid-day.
PARÁGRAFO: B. The established daily rhythm of the host brush border, with most of the remodelling events occurring in the hours surrounding dawn.
PARÁGRAFO: The data provided here, along with those of earlier studies (notably, Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998; Wier et al., 2010, and Rader et al., 2012), allow us to construct a detailed model of the brush border in early development and over the day–night cycle through the life of the host (Fig. 6). The early symbiosis is a time of rapid changes in the light organ with an underlying daily rhythm (Fig. 6A) of effacement and augmented regrowth, with associated fluctuations in AP activity, which mediate a cycle of phosphorylation on the LPS molecule. The complexity of the brush-border ultrastructure of adult crypt epithelia does not suggest that the microvilli continue to increase in their density over the several months of the squid’s life at the rate observed in the first days of the symbiosis. Instead, it appears that the mature association settles down into a rhythm of effacement and regrowth, with much of the critical underlying biochemistry occurring in the hours before and after dawn (Fig. 6B). Future investigations will focus both upon the signalling pathways activated by symbiont lipid A and on the participation of circadian rhythms in the shaping of the brush border. In addition, investigation of other features of the symbiont, such as pili, that may be required for the effective presentation of MAMPs, will be explored. Both bacteria-induced development and bacteria-entrained daily rhythms mediated by clock genes were first described in the squid-vibrio symbiosis and later found in vertebrates (Bouskra et al., 2008; Leone et al., 2015). As such, studies of whether the processes described in this contribution also occur in vertebrates may reveal important features of animal-bacterial interactions that are conserved over evolutionary time.
PARÁGRAFO: Adult E. scolopes were collected and maintained as previously described (Wollenberg and Ruby, 2012). Juveniles from the breeding colony were collected within 15 min of hatching. Aposymbiotic (Apo) animals were maintained in V. fischeri-free, unfiltered seawater. To produce the symbiotic (Sym) condition, juveniles were exposed to a given V. fischeri strain (Table 1) overnight at ~5000 colony-forming units per millilitre of seawater. Colonization state was confirmed by measuring ± luminescence output of the host with a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). In experiments with V. fischeri surface molecules, the LPS and the peptidoglycan monomer, TCT, were prepared as previously described (Foster et al., 2000; Koropatnick et al., 2004) and exposed to animals at 10 µg ml−1 and 10 µm respectively. In experiments to study the venting of luminous V. fischeri into the surrounding seawater, we removed the squid host from the vial, measured the luminescence of the squid-free seawater, and then returned the squid back into the vial. For these experiments, in addition to a given light-dark regime, animals were maintained in constant red light, which is not perceived by the animal’s visual system, but can be seen by the person manipulating the animals. All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise noted. All animal experiments conform to the relevant regulatory standards established by the University of Wisconsin – Madison.

PARÁGRAFO: For ultrastructural observations with TEM, juvenile animals were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in modified phosphate-buffered saline (mPBS) and incubated at RT for 12 h, washed in mPBS and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in mPBS for 1 h at RT. The samples were then washed in mPBS, dehydrated in an ethanol series and embedded in Spurr’s resin. Sections were visualized on a Philips CM120 Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope. Juvenile squid was prepared for immunocytochemistry as previously described (Weis et al., 1993). A polyclonal LPS antibody was used at a 1:100 dilution for 7 h in a humid chamber. Samples were examined by TEM.
PARÁGRAFO: Quantification of microvillar density was performed as previously described (Lamarcq and McFall-Ngai, 1998). Briefly, seven 5 µm fields within the largest, most mature crypt of a juvenile light organ were visualized by TEM, and all microvilli attached to epithelial cells in each field were counted to yield the linear density of microvilli, which was extrapolated to derive the microvillar density per unit area (Montgomery and McFall-Ngai, 1994). Three squid light organs were analysed for each condition. Cell swelling was determined by measuring the width of epithelial cells of the crypt. As aforementioned, seven cells were measured per light organ, and three light organs were measured per condition. All statistical comparisons were performed on the linear density using Graphpad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla CA).
PARÁGRAFO: Vibrio fischeri LPS was dephosphorylated using a protocol adapted from Bates et al., 2007. Briefly, five units of calf AP conjugated to agarose beads were suspended in PBS (50 mM sodium phosphate with 0.1 M NaCl, pH 7.4), and then exposed to 100 µg V. fischeri LPS in PBS. The sample was then incubated at 37°C for 4 h, and then the beads were pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant containing the de-phosphorylated LPS was recovered. As a negative control, the same procedure was followed with calf AP that had been heat-inactivated at 70°C for 10 min. Supernatants from both samples, at a final LPS concentration of 10 µg ml−1 of seawater, were exposed to the juvenile squid for 48 h.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Microbes have been critical drivers of evolutionary innovation in animals. To understand the processes that influence the origin of specialized symbiotic organs, we report the sequencing and analysis of the genome of Euprymna scolopes, a model cephalopod with richly characterized host–microbe interactions. We identified large-scale genomic reorganization shared between E. scolopes and Octopus bimaculoides and posit that this reorganization has contributed to the evolution of cephalopod complexity. To reveal genomic signatures of host–symbiont interactions, we focused on two specialized organs of E. scolopes: the light organ, which harbors a monoculture of Vibrio fischeri, and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG), a reproductive organ containing a bacterial consortium. Our findings suggest that the two symbiotic organs within E. scolopes originated by different evolutionary mechanisms. Transcripts expressed in these microbe-associated tissues displayed their own unique signatures in both coding sequences and the surrounding regulatory regions. Compared with other tissues, the light organ showed an abundance of genes associated with immunity and mediating light, whereas the ANG was enriched in orphan genes known only from E. scolopes. Together, these analyses provide evidence for different patterns of genomic evolution of symbiotic organs within a single host.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Reduced gravity, or microgravity, can have a pronounced impact on the physiology of animals, but the effects on their associated microbiomes are not well understood. Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of V. fischeri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological traits enables complex behaviors. The genomic basis underlying these innovations remains unknown. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid Euprymna scolopes, we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters (microsyntenies). Such novel microsyntenies correspond to topological compartments with a distinct regulatory structure and contribute to complex expression patterns. In particular, we identify a set of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) broadly enriched in cephalopod nervous system expression. We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Three-dimensionally woven poly(ε-caprolactone)(PCL) scaffolds were combined with adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) to engineer mechanically functional cartilage constructs in vitro. The specific objectives were to: (i) produce PCL scaffolds with cartilage-like mechanical properties, (ii) demonstrate that hMSCs formed cartilage after 21-days of culture on PCL scaffolds, and (iii) study effects of scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly woven), culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor), and medium composition (chondrogenic additives with or without serum). Aggregate moduli of 21-day constructs approached normal articular cartilage for tightly woven PCL cultured in bioreactors, were lower for tightly woven PCL cultured statically, and lowest for loosely woven PCL cultured statically (p<0.05). Construct DNA, total collagen, and glyocosaminoglycans (GAG) increased in a manner dependent on time, culture vessel, and medium composition. Chondrogenesis was verified histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline-like matrix that immunostained for collagen type II but not type I. Bioreactors yielded constructs with higher collagen content (p<0.05) and more homogenous matrix than static controls. Chondrogenic additives yielded constructs with higher GAG (p<0.05) and earlier expression of collagen II mRNA if serum was not present in medium. These results show feasibility of functional cartilage tissue engineering from hMSC and 3D woven PCL scaffolds.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds are promising tools for skeletal tissue engineering. We hypothesized that in vitro culture duration and medium additives can individually and interactively influence the structure, composition, mechanical, and molecular properties of engineered tissues based on hMSCs and 3D poly(ɛ-caprolactone). Bone marrow hMSCs were suspended in collagen gel, seeded on scaffolds, and cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days under chondrogenic and/or osteogenic conditions. Structure, composition, biomechanics, and gene expression were analyzed. In chondrogenic medium, cartilaginous tissue formed by day 21, and hypertrophic mineralization was observed in the newly formed extracellular matrix at the interface with underlying scaffold by day 45. Glycosaminoglycan, hydroxyproline, and calcium contents, and alkaline phosphatase activity depended on culture duration and medium additives, with significant interactive effects (all p < 0.0001). The 45-day constructs exhibited mechanical properties on the order of magnitude of native articular cartilage (aggregate, Young's, and shear moduli of 0.15, 0.12, and 0.033 MPa, respectively). Gene expression was characteristic of chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation, with sequential regulation of Sox-9, collagen type II, aggrecan, core binding factor alpha 1 (Cbfα1)/Runx2, bone sialoprotein, bone morphogenetic protein-2, and osteocalcin. In contrast, osteogenic medium produced limited osteogenesis. Long-term culture of hMSC on 3D scaffolds resulted in chondrogenesis and regional mineralization at the interface between soft, newly formed engineered cartilage, and stiffer underlying scaffold. These findings merit consideration when developing grafts for osteochondral defect repair.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: While studies have shown an increase in pathogenicity in several microbes during spaceflight and after exposure to simulated microgravity, the mechanisms underlying these changes in phenotype are not understood across different pathogens, particularly in opportunistic pathogens. This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, Serratia marcescens, in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the Drosophila melanogaster host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated S. marcescens. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated S. marcescens and provides a potential mitigation strategy.

PARÁGRAFO: A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The microbiome of the built environment comprises bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral communities associated with human-made structures. Even though most of these microbes are benign, antibiotic-resistant pathogens can colonize and emerge indoors, creating infection risk through surface transmission or inhalation. Several studies have catalogued the microbial composition and ecology in different built environment types. These have informed in vitro studies that seek to replicate the physicochemical features that promote pathogenic survival and transmission, ultimately facilitating the development and validation of intervention techniques used to reduce pathogen accumulation. Such interventions include using Bacillus-based cleaning products on surfaces or integrating bacilli into printable materials. Though this work is in its infancy, early research suggests the potential to use microbial biocontrol to reduce hospital- and home-acquired multidrug-resistant infections. Although these techniques hold promise, there is an urgent need to better understand the microbial ecology of built environments and to determine how these biocontrol solutions alter species interactions. This review covers our current understanding of microbial ecology of the built environment and proposes strategies to translate that knowledge into effective biocontrol of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Extracellular purine nucleotides appear capable of regulating plant development, defence and stress responses by acting in part as agonists of plasma membrane calcium channels. Factors stimulating ATP release include wounding, osmotic stress and elicitors. Here we show that exogenous abscisic acid and L-glutamate can also cause ATP accumulation around Arabidopsis thaliana roots. Release of ADP from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium. Root epidermal protoplasts (expressing aequorin as a cytosolic free calcium reporter) can support an extracellular ADP-induced cytosolic calcium elevation in the presence of an extracellular reductant. This confirms that ADP could elicit calcium-based responses distinct to those of ATP, which have been shown previously to involve production of extracellular reactive oxygen species.

PARÁGRAFO: Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Their sessile lifestyle means that plants have to be exquisitely sensitive to their environment, integrating many signals to appropriate developmental and physiological responses. Stimuli ranging from wounding and pathogen attack to the distribution of water and nutrients in the soil are frequently presented in a localized manner but responses are often elicited throughout the plant. Such systemic signaling is thought to operate through the redistribution of a host of chemical regulators including peptides, RNAs, ions, metabolites, and hormones. However, there are hints of a much more rapid communication network that has been proposed to involve signals ranging from action and system potentials to reactive oxygen species. We now show that plants also possess a rapid stress signaling system based on Ca2+ waves that propagate through the plant at rates of up to ∼400 µm/s. In the case of local salt stress to the Arabidopsis thaliana root, Ca2+ wave propagation is channeled through the cortex and endodermal cell layers and this movement is dependent on the vacuolar ion channel TPC1. We also provide evidence that the Ca2+ wave/TPC1 system likely elicits systemic molecular responses in target organs and may contribute to whole-plant stress tolerance. These results suggest that, although plants do not have a nervous system, they do possess a sensory network that uses ion fluxes moving through defined cell types to rapidly transmit information between distant sites within the organism.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Gravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin. Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 (zig-1), a mutant allele of VTI11, which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller than 70 μm in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypocotyls. This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls, which enhanced shoot gravitropism in zig-1 mutants. Live-cell imaging of zig-1 hypocotyl endodermal cells indicated that amyloplasts are trapped between juxtaposed vacuoles and their movement is severely restricted. Wortmannin-induced fusion of vacuoles in zig-1 seedlings increased the formation of transvacuolar strands, enhanced amyloplast sedimentation and partially suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 seedlings. Hypergravity conditions at 10 g were not sufficient to displace amyloplasts in zig-1, suggesting the existence of a physical tether between the vacuole and amyloplasts. Our results overall suggest that vacuole membrane remodeling may be involved in regulating the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts during graviperception.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Plants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body, even to highly localized and quickly changing environmental stresses. The propagation of these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytoplasmic Ca2+ traveling throughout the plant. For the Ca2+ wave system, the involvement of the vacuolar ion channel TWO PORE CHANNEL1 (TPC1) has been reported. However, the precise role of this channel and the mechanism of cell-to-cell propagation of the wave have remained largely undefined. Here, we use the fire-diffuse-fire model to analyze the behavior of a Ca2+ wave originating from Ca2+ release involving the TPC1 channel in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We conclude that a Ca2+ diffusion-dominated calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism is insufficient to explain the observed wave transmission speeds. The addition of a ROS-triggered element, however, is able to quantitatively reproduce the observed transmission characteristics. The treatment of roots with the ROS scavenger ascorbate and the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium and analysis of Ca2+ wave propagation in the Arabidopsis respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (AtrbohD) knockout background all led to reductions in Ca2+ wave transmission speeds consistent with this model. Furthermore, imaging of extracellular ROS production revealed a systemic spread of ROS release that is dependent on both AtRBOHD and TPC1. These results suggest that, in the root, plant systemic signaling is supported by a ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium-release mechanism intimately involving ROS production by AtRBOHD and Ca2+ release dependent on the vacuolar channel TPC1.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Systemic signaling and systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) are essential for plant survival during episodes of environmental stress. Recent studies highlighted a key role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling in mediating systemic responses and SAA during light stress in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). These studies further identified the RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG D (RBOHD) protein as a key player in mediating rapid systemic ROS responses. Here, we report that tissue-specific expression of RBOHD in phloem or xylem parenchyma cells of the rbohD mutant restores systemic ROS signaling, systemic stress-response transcript expression, and SAA to a local treatment of light stress. We further demonstrate that RBOHD and RBOHF are both required for local and systemic ROS signaling at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis. Taken together, our findings highlight a key role for RBOHD-driven ROS production at the vascular bundles of Arabidopsis in mediating light stress–induced systemic signaling and SAA. In addition, they suggest that the integration of ROS, calcium, electric, and hydraulic signals, during systemic signaling, occurs at the vascular bundles.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Calcium ions are predicted to be key signaling entities during biotic interactions, with calcium signaling forming an established part of the plant defense response to microbial elicitors and to wounding caused by chewing insects, eliciting systemic calcium signals in plants. However, the role of calcium in vivo during biotic stress is still unclear. This protocol describes the use of a genetically-encoded calcium sensor to detect calcium signals in plants during feeding by a hemipteran pest. Hemipterans such as aphids pierce a small number of cells with specialized, elongated sucking mouthparts, making them the ideal tool to study calcium dynamics when a plant is faced with a biotic stress, which is distinct from a wounding response. In addition, fluorescent biosensors are revolutionizing the measurement of signaling molecules in vivo in both animals and plants. Expressing a GFP-based calcium biosensor, GCaMP3, in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the real-time imaging of plant calcium dynamics during insect feeding, with a high spatial and temporal resolution. A repeatable and robust assay has been developed using the fluorescence microscopy of detached GCaMP3 leaves, allowing for the continuous measurement of cytosolic calcium dynamics before, during, and after insect feeding. This reveals a highly-localized rapid calcium elevation around the aphid feeding site that occurs within a few minutes. The protocol can be adapted to other biotic stresses, such as additional insect species, while the use of Arabidopsis thaliana allows for the rapid generation of mutants to facilitate the molecular analysis of the phenomenon.

PARÁGRAFO: Plants show a rapid systemic response to a wide range of environmental stresses, where the signals from the site of stimulus perception are transmitted to distal organs to elicit plant-wide responses. A wide range of signaling molecules are trafficked through the plant, but a trio of potentially interacting messengers, reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and electrical signaling (‘trio signaling’) appear to form a network supporting rapid signal transmission. The molecular components underlying this rapid communication are beginning to be identified, such as the ROS producing NAPDH oxidase RBOHD, the ion channel two pore channel 1 (TPC1), and glutamate receptor-like channels GLR3.3 and GLR3.6. The plant cell wall presents a plant-specific route for possible propagation of signals from cell to cell. However, the degree to which the cell wall limits information exchange between cells via transfer of small molecules through an extracellular route, or whether it provides an environment to facilitate transmission of regulators such as ROS or H+ remains to be determined. Similarly, the role of plasmodesmata as both conduits and gatekeepers for the propagation of rapid cell-to-cell signaling remains a key open question. Regardless of how signals move from cell to cell, they help prepare distant parts of the plant for impending challenges from specific biotic or abiotic stresses.

PARÁGRAFO: Plants are constantly bombarded by stimuli and, through a combination of physiological and developmental responses, they adapt to their ever-changing environment. Although some stimuli such as changes in air temperature or day/night transitions essentially arrive simultaneously to aerial parts of the plant, many of the signals that are key to the plant’s success, including herbivory, touch or pathogen attack are perceived locally within the plant, but the responses they elicit are often propagated throughout the entire plant body. Thus, organs not directly receiving the stimulus respond to long-range signals exported from the site of perception. Such systemic signals include cell-to-cell, organ-to-organ (shoot-to-shoot, root-to-root, root-to-shoot and shoot-to-root) and, possibly, even plant-to-plant communication. This long-distance systemic signaling network essentially allows the whole plant to prepare for future challenges. These types of systemic responses can be divided into two major classes: (i) systemic acquired resistance (SAR), typically triggered by pathogens; and (ii) systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) that is induced by abiotic stress stimuli, such as high light, temperature, wounding and osmotic stress. These systemic signal response networks have been shown to improve plant fitness. For example, in Arabidopsis plants responding to a bacterial pathogen, a prior induction of SAR resulted in plants with increased biomass and greater than 50% more seed (Traw et al., 2007). Indeed, priming of defenses (i.e. the ability to mount a larger response after receiving an initial stress) occurs in response to many biotic and abiotic stress signals (Conrath et al., 2015) and, for example, in the case of SAR, the induced improvements in plant defense induction can be passed to the next generation (Luna et al., 2012).
PARÁGRAFO: Such rapid signal propagation throughout the plant body has been proposed to occur through both symplastic (cytoplasmic) and apoplastic (extracellular) pathways. For example, on the symplastic side, the phloem has been shown to rapidly transport systemic signals ranging from proteins and mRNAs to small molecules and metabolites at rates of several hundred μm sec−1 (reviewed in Haroldsen et al., 2012; Turnbull and Lopez-Cobollo, 2013; Ham and Lucas, 2014). However, recent evidence suggests that many of the proteins trafficked in the phloem may simply be non-specifically lost from companion cells to the sieve elements and then passively caught and redistributed in the translocation stream (Paultre et al., 2016). Similarly, mRNA movement in phloem may be related to abundance in the companion cell/sieve tube complex, suggesting much of this mobile RNA pool may not be related to selective loading and trafficking of specific information containing molecules in the translocation stream (Calderwood et al., 2016). Indeed, grafting experiments have detected in excess of 2000 mobile RNAs trafficking between root stock and scion, which is perhaps more consistent with a large non-specific trafficking capacity than the targeted exchange of multiple key systemic regulators (Thieme et al., 2015). Thus, mobility alone does not necessarily reveal a messenger carrying specific systemic information. However, there are many cases where a role for phloem mobile signals in the regulation of distant target site activity has been demonstrated. For example, the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein has been shown to move in the symplasm from the site of light perception (the leaves) to distant target sites, where it elicits the transition from vegetative to floral meristem development. Thus, the FT protein produced by phloem companion cells is loaded to the sieve elements in a highly regulated process that is mediated by other factors such as FT INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (Liu et al., 2012). FT is then transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem via the symplastic pathway, resulting in its eventual interaction with FLOWERING LOCUS D, which then promotes flowering (Corbesier et al., 2007; Jaeger and Wigge, 2007; Mathieu et al., 2007). Critically, inhibiting FT movement prevents the transfer of flowering information (reviewed in Ham and Lucas, 2014).
PARÁGRAFO: Indeed, a suite of such mobile signals has been defined that trigger systemic response to local stimuli. The molecules carrying this information range from hormones, proteins, RNAs and metabolites, to a rapid, self-reinforcing network of events related to a trio of regulators: reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+ and electrical signals (reviewed in Choi et al., 2016; Gilroy et al., 2016). The machinery behind the cell-to-cell propagating nature of each of these various rapid signaling systems is beginning to emerge (Figure 1; reviewed in Choi et al., 2016; Gilroy et al., 2016; Hedrich et al., 2016), as are candidates for sensors potentially directly triggering these systems, such as the OSCA1 osmotically responsive Ca2+ channel (Yuan et al., 2014). However, in this update, we will concentrate on asking what information content this signaling network is likely to carry and how the signal itself can move at speeds exceeding 1000 μm sec−1? That is, what are the challenges to a systemic signal that must traverse tens of cell lengths per second?
PARÁGRAFO: Salt-stress-associated Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave propagation in plants. A salt-stress-triggered cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) increase is dependent on the tonoplast-localized TWO PORE CHANNEL 1 (TPC1) cation channel (Choi et al., 2014). The resultant [Ca2+]cyt increase is propagated through the cell in a wave front supported by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that is either directly or indirectly supported by TPC1 action. In addition, H2O2 accumulation in the apoplast is generated by the PM-localized RBOHD NADPH oxidase, that is itself activated by Ca2+ through internal Ca2+-binding sites (EF-hands) and a variety of Ca2+-dependent, post-translational regulators (reviewed in Choi et al., 2016). The apoplastic transmission of accumulated extracellular H2O2 is thought to drive cell-to-cell transmission of the propagating wave (Evans et al., 2016).

PARÁGRAFO: Cell-to-cell communication plays a key role in the biology of both multicellular and unicellular organisms (Raven et al., 2014). In unicellular organisms such communication is crucial for sexual reproduction, and the formation, maintenance and differentiation of different cell populations such as crusts, biofilms, filaments, fruiting bodies and other communities (Claessen et al., 2014). In multicellular organisms cell-to-cell communication is essential for sexual reproduction, morphological development, physiological homeostasis, defense and acclimation to the environment (Raven et al., 2014). At a basic level and over short distances, cell-to-cell communication in plants is different from that of animal cells (Figure 2; Bloemendal and Kuck, 2013). Cell-to-cell communication in animal cells can be mediated through the secretion of small molecules to the medium between cells (that then trigger receptors on systemic target cells), the transfer of extracellular vesicles such as exosomes (30–150 nm) and microvesicles (100–1500 nm), or via direct cytosolic connections such as gap junctions (2–3 nm) and tunneling nanotubes (50–700 nm). In addition, many multicellular animals use a parallel signaling network, where rapid signaling is accomplished using cellular networks highly specialized to rapidly transmit electrical signal over long distances, i.e. a nervous system (reviewed in Goodenough and Paul, 2009; Herve and Derangeon, 2013).
PARÁGRAFO: Routes of cell-to-cell communication in plant and animal cells. Simplified models for the transmission of signals between two plant (a) and animal (b) cells are shown. Signals are transported between cells via secretion of molecules (a and b) or vesicles (b), or direct physical cell-to-cell connections (PDs in a, and gap junctions and tunneling nanotubes in b). CW, cell wall; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GJ, gap junction; PD, plasmodesma; PM, plasma membrane; TNT, tunneling nanotubes.
PARÁGRAFO: In plants, the presence of the cell wall between cells constitutes a physical and chemical barrier that keeps neighboring cells at a larger physical distance from each other than most animal cells and so impacts on some of the possible cell-to-cell communication pathways outlined above (Figure 2). For example, because of the predicted size exclusion limit that is imposed by its constituent polysaccharide networks, the cell wall is likely to significantly limit or prevent extracellular vesicle transport between cells. The cell wall may also alter the chemistry of some small molecules that are secreted into the apoplast due to the presence of peroxidases, oxidases and other enzymes associated with it. In addition, the cell wall contains high levels of Ca2+ and other ions, and is kept at a significantly lower pH compared with that of the cytosol providing a unique chemical environment for signals to move within. However, many plant cells are connected by plasmodesmata (PD), which provide a more direct route for cell-to-cell communication. PD provide a symplastic connection for the transfer of ions, metabolites, hormones, proteins, RNAs and other molecules. Although animal cells have an extracellular matrix and cytoplasmic connections such as gap junctions, the plant cell wall and PD connections are structurally very different and represent plant-specific features that can impact rapid information transfer between cells.
PARÁGRAFO: Plasmodesmata have pore sizes of 20–50 nm, which represent highly regulated cellular transport points. Size exclusion limits of PD are typically measured between ~30 kDa (Imlau et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2005) and ~60–70 kDa (Rim et al., 2011), but are known to vary between cell types, their developmental status and especially in response to environmental stimuli. Even macromolecules such as large proteins can move through PDs to control developmental programs. For example, the Arabidopsis transcription factor SHORTROOT (SHR) is translocated from cells of the stele and the quiescent center to the endodermis via a PD-mediated route (Vaten et al., 2011), resulting in activation of another transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR; Helariutta et al., 2000; Nakajima et al., 2001). In the endodermis, SCR subsequently induces the expression of microRNAs 165 and 166, which are then translocated from the endodermis to pith tissues in the stele through PDs. In the pith, these microRNAs trigger a transcriptional cascade that establishes proper development of pericycle, protoxlem and metaxylem cells (Carlsbecker et al., 2010; Miyashima et al., 2011). Similarly, in the shoot apical meristem of maize, the KNOTTED1 transcriptional regulator is expressed in the L2 layer, but moves to the L1 layer through PDs via a chaperone-dependent mechanism in order to maintain stem cell homeostasis (Lucas et al., 1995; Xu et al., 2011). KNOTTED1 also increases the size exclusion limit of PD to facilitate its own motility.
PARÁGRAFO: Indeed, PD conductivity can be regulated by an array of different factors (Figure 2; Lucas, 1995; Tilsner et al., 2016). For example, the size exclusion limit for PDs appears to be tightly regulated by callose deposition, and synthesis of this polymer responds to various stress conditions, such as wounding and pathogen attack (Samuels et al., 1995; Parre and Geitmann, 2005; Chen and Kim, 2009). In Arabidopsis, callose synthases are encoded by a 12-member gene family, with CALLOSE SYNTHASE 3 being localized on plasma membranes (PMs) and involved in depositing callose into cell wall (Vaten et al., 2011). As observed by electron microscopy, callose can accumulate in the cell wall surrounding the PD (Vaten et al., 2011). The accumulation of callose in this region is thought to constrict the size of the PD, and thereby restrict or block intercellular movement through the symplast. PDs are known to be enriched in specific proteins (Fernandez-Calvino et al., 2011) and lipids that likely lead to the recruitment of a host of regulators, making these structures exquisitely responsive to their cellular environment. For example, PDs show accumulation of sterols and sphinogolipids that could play a role in defining novel membrane microdomains. Indeed, this novel lipid environment has been proposed to be linked to regulating cell-to-cell connectivity of the PD as well as regulating their callose modifying enzyme activity (Grison et al., 2015).
PARÁGRAFO: The symplastic movement of small molecules such as cytokinin, salicylic acid, auxin and gibberellic acid appear to be highly dependent on PD permeability (Kwiatkowska, 1991; Kwiatkowska and Malinowski, 1995; Bishopp et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014; Lee, 2015). Thus, both small and large signaling molecules can use the PD as a means to travel systemically from cell to cell, although we are still far from fully understanding the extent to which movement of these kinds of molecules via PDs contributes to systemic response throughout the plant.
PARÁGRAFO: In the context of rapid cell-to-cell, long-distance signaling mechanisms that mediate SAA in plants (Mittler et al., 2011; Gilroy et al., 2016), it is still unclear what role PD play in the propagation of ROS, Ca2+ and electric signals (Figure 2). There are three potential paths for the propagation of these signals from cell to cell. The first is independent of the PD, and might occur directly across cell walls that separate neighboring cells (Figure 2; ‘apoplastic through cell wall’). The second is via symplastic connections provided by PD, either through the cytosolic cavity, or traversing the endoplasmic reticum (ER) membranes that permeate the PD. The third might occur along the outer surface of the PD between the PM and surrounding cell wall (‘apoplastic not through cell wall’). While there are analogous mechanisms for cell-cell communication in animal cells (e.g. gap junctions provide a cytoplasmic connection between adjacent cells as do PD, although it is important to note that at a structural level, gap junctions and PDs are very different; Figure 2), an important difference is the potential enhancing or buffering influence of the plant cell wall.
PARÁGRAFO: For the rapid systemic auto-propagating ROS wave, genetic evidence indicates a requirement for the respiratory burst homolog (RBOH) protein RBOHD (Miller et al., 2009; Mittler et al., 2011; Evans et al., 2016). The propagation rate of this ROS-related system ranges from ~400 to 1400 μm sec−1 depending on the type of stress and the type of tissues receiving stress. For example, a salt-stress-triggered apoplastic ROS wave moved through the root at ~400 μm sec−1, whereas wound-induced activation of the ROS system moved in the aerial parts of the plant in excess of 1000 μm sec−1. These speeds were calculated from measuring the timing of either the systemic appearance of ROS in the apoplast (salt stress; Evans et al., 2016) or activation of a very rapid (20 sec transcript accumulation response time; Suzuki et al., 2015) transcriptional reporter (ZAT12pro:LUC) shown to require ROS changes for its systemic induction (wounding; Miller et al., 2009). The current model is that a ROS burst triggers neighboring RBOHs to make another ROS burst, thereby providing a mechanism for a ROS-induced ROS propagation along the surface of the PM. However, in moving this ROS wave from one cell to the next, it is not clear how the wave propagates across the distance that separates neighboring cells. Cell walls represent a significant barrier, not only because of the distance created between cells, but also because the apoplast can provide a high antioxidative capacity that can quench a ROS signal. However, quenching can also be a factor in ROS diffusing through a symplastic connection. Thus, one model for propagating a ROS signal to the next cell is to simply continue the RBOH-mediated ROS-induced ROS burst along the continuum of PM that spans the PD. However, RBOHD has not been observed as a prominent protein in the Arabidopsis plasmodesmal proteome, making it unclear if this simple model is correct (Fernandez-Calvino et al., 2011). Regardless of the specific pathway, isolated plasmodesmal fractions appear to contain a range of ROS-processing enzymes such as peroxidases that would likely regulate ROS dynamics, either on the surface of the PD, or within the symplastic connection (Fernandez-Calvino et al., 2011).
PARÁGRAFO: An alternative model for propagating the ROS wave from cell to cell is that a different signaling molecule is used as a relay to traverse the symplastic or apoplastic connections. For example, the Ca2+ transients observed in the context of long-distance signaling are assisted by RBOHD-generated ROS (Evans et al., 2016), and vice versa, with Ca2+ signals being implicated in activating RBOHD to generate ROS (Figure 1; Dubiella et al., 2013; Kadota et al., 2015). Because the mobility of Ca2+ in the wall is highly restricted, for example by Ca2+ interactions with free carboxylic groups of pectins, it is generally thought that Ca2+ waves propagate between cells via symplastic connections provided by PD. Indeed, cytosolically targeted Ca2+ imaging bioprobes were instrumental in initially discovering this Ca2+ wave system (Choi et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2014; Kiep et al., 2015). However, it is not clear if the source of Ca2+ is from influx pathways associated with the PM or ER membranes that traverse the PD, or a simple diffusion of Ca2+ through the cytoplasmic cavity. Nevertheless, modeling suggests a simple cytosolic diffusion-based PD transit cannot support the speed of Ca2+ wave propagation seen in vivo (Evans et al., 2016). Thus, the Ca2+ wave propagation through PDs is likely to involve regulation of Ca2+ channels associated with either the PM or ER (Gilroy et al., 2016).
PARÁGRAFO: A third alternative is the propagation of an electrical signal along the PM connection through the PD. Mechanisms based on, for example, the gating of voltage-sensitive Ca2+-permeable channels could then initiate Ca2+-coupled ROS-response pathways, linking the Ca2+, ROS and electrical signaling into a single interconnected network. In addition, it is possible that electric waves could jump between cells using a different mechanism that does not utilize PD (Gilroy et al., 2016). Further research is needed to address this and all other questions outlined above.
PARÁGRAFO: In addition to the currently open question as to the precise route that transfers rapid systemic signals between adjacent plant cells, understanding the role that the plant cell types or tissues play in mediating these systemic signals also holds promise to help reveal mechanism and function. Thus, while the ROS wave was detected in the apoplast of epidermal cells (Miller et al., 2009), rapid systemic signaling in response to abiotic stress also occurs via the phloem tissue and its companion cells (reviewed in Gilroy et al., 2014; Hedrich et al., 2016). In addition, rapidly propagating signals could also be transferred via parenchyma and other cell types, with, for example, the rapid Ca2+ wave triggered by local salt treatment preferentially propagating through the cortex and endodermal cell layers in the root (Choi et al., 2014). What makes each of these tissues uniquely suited to carry specific stress-related systemic signals remains unknown. From the standpoint of number, size and PD characteristics, phloem tissue, companion cells and the epidermis contain a high number of cellular connections and could be a good pathway for the transfer of different systemic signals that propagate through both the apoplast and PD. Moreover, the transport of coupled signals such as ROS and Ca2+ waves (Gilroy et al., 2014, 2016), Ca2+ and electric signals (Mousavi et al., 2013), and/or ROS and electric signals (Suzuki et al., 2013) suggests that many of these signals use the same tissues and cell types as a conduit, and are not mediated via spatially separated routes. Future studies utilizing more sensitive and specific imaging tools for the ROS, Ca2+ and perhaps even electric signals should help resolve these important questions.
PARÁGRAFO: In addition to ROS signals, the apoplast is also a conduit for systemic changes in extracellular pH and exhibits changes in electrical signals that result from ion flow across the membranes of underlying cells, such as seen in response to mycorrhizal fungus and to wounding (Felle et al., 2009; Zimmermann et al., 2009; Mousavi et al., 2013). Thus, rapid acidification of the apoplast in response to inoculation of the roots with chlamydospores of the mycorrhizal fungus Piriformospora indica was observed in the root elongation zone within seconds to minutes in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). However, surface pH also subsequently decreased by 1 unit in the shootward systemic leaves, suggesting activation of the H+-ATPase at the PM both in local and systemic tissues in response to biotic stress (Felle et al., 2009). The systemic signal in this case would be moving at several hundred μm sec−1. Similarly, salt stress to the root system triggers a systemic apoplastic pH increase in the leaves in maize (Geilfus et al., 2015). These observations raise the question of whether H+ ions exported from the cytosol to the apoplast are themselves transmitted to systemic tissues or, perhaps more likely, is some other signal, such as a propagating electrical wave to activate PM-localized H+-ATPases to acidify the apoplast at distal locations? To answer these questions, measurement of the apoplast pH changes in local and systemic tissues with pH biosensors such as pHusion (Gjetting et al., 2012) or wall targeted pHuji (Shen et al., 2014) should shed light on how the surface pH changes when plants perceive biotic or abiotic stress. Importantly, it is unknown whether these pH changes themselves convey information, or if they are simply occurring as a consequence of changes in the activity of the PM-localized H+-ATPase that is altering other features of the cell such as cytosolic pH or membrane potential.
PARÁGRAFO: Long-distance electrical signals monitored, for example, as surface potential changes have been detected with propagation speeds ranging from 100 sec to >1000 μm sec−1 (reviewed in Choi et al., 2016). This variability in speeds may well relate to the type of stress triggering the signaling events (e.g. wounding versus salt stress), the site of local stress perception (e.g. root versus leaf) and the cell types through which the signal propagates (e.g. parenchyma versus vasculature).
PARÁGRAFO: In Fava bean and barley leaves, similar to the apoplastic systemic pH changes, wounding stress triggered electrical signals that were initially detected in the local wounded leaf, and displayed a long-distance systemic movement at a rate of 800–1600 μm sec−1 (Zimmermann et al., 2009). These wound-induced systemic electrical signals are also thought to be controlled by activating PM-localized H+-ATPases, indicating a possible association of the extracellular systemic pH and the apoplastic long-distance electrical signals. In Arabidopsis leaves, wounding-associated long-distance electrical signals are also detectable using surface potential monitoring electrodes (Mousavi et al., 2013). This long-distance wounding-associated electrical wave traverses the plant at the rate of 1000 μm sec−1 and is dependent on clade III glutamate receptor-like channels (GLR3.3 and 3.6). These GLR-mediated long-range electrical signals appear to play key roles in regulating defense-related gene expression markers, such as JAZ7 and JAZ10, as well as accumulation of biologically active jasmonate isoleucine (JA-Ile; Mousavi et al., 2013). Indeed, the GLR family has also been implicated in modulating features of electrical signaling in the phloem’s symplastic route for systemic signal propagation, with roles in both propagating and limiting the spread of the signal (Hedrich et al., 2016).
PARÁGRAFO: Because the apoplast is the compartment directly facing the plant’s environment, regulating, the composition of this apoplastic space provides a first layer of defense against pathogen attacks and other environmental stresses (Delaunois et al., 2014). Therefore, it has been long speculated that apoplastic macromolecules such as proteins and oligosaccharides are likely involved in sensing initial environmental interactions and potentially generating or sustaining long-distance signaling. The dynamic nature of cell wall peptide signals is highlighted by the work of Hafidh et al. (2016) who demonstrated that tobacco pollen tubes secrete >800 proteins during pollen tube growth. Major classes of secreted proteins were <20 kDa and played critical roles in guiding male pollen tubes to female ovules to facilitate fertilization. This secretome analysis during pollen tube growth hints at the wealth of macromolecules that are dynamically released to the apoplast. These apoplastic peptides can function not only as important developmental regulators, but mechanistic analysis of the small secreted peptide RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR shows that these kinds of regulators could also conceivably play roles in systemic signaling. Thus, RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR and its cognate receptor-like kinase FERONIA likely relay information about the status of the cell wall (Shih et al., 2014) and modulate both Ca2+ and H+ dynamics (Haruta et al., 2008, 2014). However, whether such signals are contributing to modulating systemic signaling or potentially even move in a systemic manner themselves remains to be fully defined.
PARÁGRAFO: As noted above, many messengers have been described to carry information between cells to generate systemic biological responses, including electric signals, RNA molecules, peptides and proteins, phytohormones, ionic changes and ROS (Choi et al., 2016; Gilroy et al., 2016; Hedrich et al., 2016; Tilsner et al., 2016). Given the identification of azelaic acid (Jung et al., 2009) and glycerol-3-phosphate (Chanda et al., 2011) as novel, rapidly accumulating, mobile signals likely involved in SAR in recent years, it is likely that there are many currently unidentified plant messengers to be discovered.
PARÁGRAFO: However, compared with ‘slow’ mobile messengers, such as jasmonic and salicylic acids that take several minutes to accumulate and then induce SAR within several hours (Truman et al., 2007), the propagation rate of ROS and Ca2+ waves as well as electric signaling is rapid, ranging from ~100 to >1000 μm sec−1 (Choi et al., 2016). It is possible that Ca2+, ROS and electrical signals all function together as a rapid systemic signal carrying specific information about a local stress to distal parts of the plant (Miller et al., 2009; Mousavi et al., 2013; Choi et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2016). Such specific information would allow the plant to elicit highly focused responses to prepare against further challenges associated with a particular stress (Conrath et al., 2015). For example, the rapid ROS-mediated activation of SAA in the Arabidopsis localized high light stress response protects distal naive rosette or cauline leaves against a subsequent light stress treatment that would have otherwise been lethal (Miller et al., 2009; Szechynska-Hebda et al., 2010; Suzuki et al., 2013).
PARÁGRAFO: The specificity of the systemic signal is dependent on the ability of that signal to elicit responses in unaffected tissue to protect or defend the plant from a second occurrence of that same or tightly associated stress (e.g. salinity or drought both share osmotic stress facets). In some cases, however, cross-protection is also seen, in which one type of locally applied stress is capable of generating a protective response or acclimation to another type of biotic or abiotic stress (Traw et al., 2007; Perez and Brown, 2014). These types of experiments indicate that a significant degree of overlap exists between systemic signaling events and the mechanisms that respond to it. Yet, in other instances different local stimuli such as heat stress, high light and wounding stress induce distinct stress-specific SAAs that share little overlap in expression of transcripts and metabolites, resulting in very limited to no cross-protection (Suzuki et al., 2013).
PARÁGRAFO: These observations of stress-specific SAAs support the hypothesis that a general non-specific signal is produced and then exported from the local tissue that functions to prime SAA or SAR, but that this initial local signal is not sufficient to protect the systemic tissue from the specific subsequent stress (Figure 3). The fact that ROS and Ca2+ waves and electrical signals appear in response to many different stimuli suggests that either stimulus-specific signals are encoded within the spatial and temporal dynamics of these waves, or that they may be acting as an initial, general priming signal, preparing the plant to respond in a more selective way to subsequent, stimulus-specific signals.
PARÁGRAFO: Model of possible propagation of general and stress-specific systemic signals. Local stress stimuli triggers changes in membrane potentials, increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] and activation of RBOHD-mediated oxidative burst leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, i.e. trio signaling. The association between the signals generates a wave that rapidly spreads throughout the plant in an auto-propagating manner, traversing through the apoplast outside the cell and/or symplastically through PD. This initial signaling wave acts as a priming signal, which is required, but not sufficient for systemic acquired acclimation (SAA). The priming wave activates the core environmental stress response genes (CESRs). Following the general signaling wave, depending on the type of stress, a second wave of systemic stress-specific systemic signaling starts, activating stress-specific genes and cellular mechanisms that facilitate SAA against the same type of stress that triggered the initial response.

PARÁGRAFO: From an evolutionary point of view, sending a general stress message to all parts of the plant may be an efficient means to rapidly prepare all of its tissues for the upcoming challenges and increase its survival chances. As it can often take several hours for pathogens to spread from an infected tissue to healthy tissue, or for damages caused by environmental changes to reach a critical point of massive tissue disruption, there would be enough time for a slower more specific signal to develop and move to distal parts of the plant that are already primed to facilitate stronger stress-specific resistance or acclimation response.
PARÁGRAFO: A possible mechanism of signal propagation based on the interaction of the trio of messengers (Ca2+, ROS and electrical signals) is outlined in Figure 3, where changes in these messengers act to propagate a priming signal, with stimulus-specific information being encoded in another downstream signal transduction system operating in parallel. However, the idea of an initial priming wave of ROS, Ca2+ and electric signals, which is followed by stimulus-specific messengers, raises several questions that pose future challenges. (i) How are the ROS, Ca2+ and electrical signals integrated to provide a general priming signal and how could this general message be perceived in target tissues? (ii) What is the relationship between the general systemic signal and the following specific signals? Are they dependent or independent? (iii) What triggers the accumulation of the specific secondary message in the systemic tissue? (iv) How would a general priming signal prepare the systemic tissues for an improved subsequent specific response?
PARÁGRAFO: The ROS-responsive transcription factor ZAT12 is one of the best-known markers for transcript-level systemic activation and may provide clues as to what a general priming mechanism may look like. ZAT12 transcription is activated by ROS (Davletova et al., 2005; Miller et al., 2009; Suzuki et al., 2015) and by the Ca2+ wave (Choi et al., 2014) within 20–60 sec of stress perception (Suzuki et al., 2015). ZAT12 is also part of a cluster of Arabidopsis early-inducing genes commonly responsive to a wide range of abiotic stresses. Indeed, this grouping was classified as containing plant general response genes and core environmental stress response components (CESR; Ma and Bohnert, 2007; Hahn et al., 2013). These genes may represent the frontline of general systemic response to the initial priming signal common to most abiotic stresses. It can therefore be postulated that CESR genes are also likely targets for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory/signaling components that are activated by ROS/redox changes induced by the NADPH oxidase (RBOH) family.
PARÁGRAFO: NADPH oxidase-mediated activation cascades are well-described in human growth hormone-induced oxidative signaling, in which an increase in intracellular concentration of H2O2 switches off redox-responsive phosphatases, driving signal transduction by enabling kinase activity (Finkel, 2011). Similar oxidative-signaling cascades may well be activated by plant RBOHs.
PARÁGRAFO: Further, ZAT12 is a direct target of transcriptional regulators such as ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3 (Chang et al., 2013) and CIRCADEAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1; Lai et al., 2012), as well as a host of other regulatory proteins including bZIP29, NAC91 (Ben Daniel et al., 2016) and probably many other unidentified transcriptional regulators. Some of these Zat12 and other CESR gene regulators may act as redox-sensitive proteins that are either directly activated by dithiol-disulfide exchanges between cysteine residues or indirectly by other post-transcription modifications, such as phosphorylation. Such post-translational regulation would provide a pathway to translate the trio of Ca2+/ROS/electrical signals, via its ROS component, to transcriptional regulation of general stress response genes that represent the priming effect in the systemic tissue.
PARÁGRAFO: A signal-carrying specificity would need to modulate this general priming response system. Clues to this process may again be seen in the ROS responsive network. For example, the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) acts as a heat-stress-specific component of SAA signaling (Suzuki et al., 2013), showing a transient increase in systemic leaves after 10 min of heat stress is applied at a distal site. Yet, ABA accumulation was dependent on ROS production by RBOHD. These findings suggest that the specific signal, in this case ABA, is modulated by the systemic ROS (priming) signal. Thus, we hypothesize that complex synergistic relationships exist between the initial priming signaling wave and stress-specific signals. These interactions may influence one another, governing both the general priming events of systemic response and associated stimulus-specific changes. Such regulatory loops may perhaps help to explain some of the perplexing questions of the rapid systemic signaling system, such as why the ROS or Ca2+ waves are required but not sufficient for the induction of a complete SAA response (Miller et al., 2009; Choi et al., 2014).

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Animals rely on nervous systems to cope with environmental variability, whereas plants are characterized by lack of nervous system but still have evolved systemic communication systems through signaling molecules that trigger long-distance defense signaling events when encountered with environmental challenges. Here, our genetic screening of the previously constructed hairpin RNA-based Arabidopsis library identifies a glutathione (GSH)-deficient mutant that has high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously defined wound signal essential for activating plant defense, but disharmoniously exhibits attenuation of defense signaling events. We further uncover GSH as a critical signaling molecule that relies on GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR-LIKE 3.3 (GLR3.3) to trigger long-distance calcium-based defense signaling events in plants. Our findings offer new insights into highly sophisticated systemic defense systems evolved by plants to defend against herbivory and pathogen invasion.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Recent advances in the routine access to space along with increasing opportunities to perform plant growth experiments on board the International Space Station have led to an ever-increasing body of transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data from plants experiencing spaceflight. These datasets hold great promise to help understand how plant biology reacts to this unique environment. However, analyses that mine across such expanses of data are often complex to implement, being impeded by the sheer number of potential comparisons that are possible. Complexities in how the output of these multiple parallel analyses can be presented to the researcher in an accessible and intuitive form provides further barriers to such research. Recent developments in computational systems biology have led to rapid advances in interactive data visualization environments designed to perform just such tasks. However, to date none of these tools have been tailored to the analysis of the broad-ranging plant biology spaceflight data. We have therefore developed the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database (https://astrobiology.botany.wisc.edu/astrobotany-toast) to address this gap in our capabilities. TOAST is a relational database that uses the Qlik database management software to link plant biology, spaceflight-related omics datasets, and their associated metadata. This environment helps visualize relationships across multiple levels of experiments in an easy to use gene-centric platform. TOAST draws on data from The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA’s) GeneLab and other data repositories and also connects results to a suite of web-based analytical tools to facilitate further investigation of responses to spaceflight and related stresses. The TOAST graphical user interface allows for quick comparisons between plant spaceflight experiments using real-time, gene-specific queries, or by using functional gene ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway, or other filtering systems to explore genetic networks of interest. Testing of the database shows that TOAST confirms patterns of gene expression already highlighted in the literature, such as revealing the modulation of oxidative stress-related responses across multiple plant spaceflight experiments. However, this data exploration environment can also drive new insights into patterns of spaceflight responsive gene expression. For example, TOAST analyses highlight changes to mitochondrial function as likely shared responses in many plant spaceflight experiments.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca2+ transients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca2+ transporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca2+ dynamics during the triggering of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca2+ from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic phenotypes. We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling and related defense responses. The double-knockout aca4/11 exhibited increased basal Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ signals of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca2+ dynamics and associated defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing the aca4/11 seedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tonoplast also suppressed the aca4/11 phenotypes but not when a catalytically inactive mutant was used. These observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration is an integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps does not require specific regulatory elements not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Plants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to rapid, plant-wide responses. In addition to the redistribution of chemical messengers that range from RNAs and peptides to hormones and metabolites, a communication system acting through the transmission of electrical, Ca2+, reactive oxygen species and potentially even hydraulic signals has also been discovered. This latter system can propagate signals across many cells each second and researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network. Thus, elements such as the reactive oxygen species producing NAPDH oxidases and ion channels of the two pore channel, glutamate receptor-like and cyclic nucleotide gated families are all required for the rapid propagation of these signals. Upon arrival at their distant targets, these changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. These systemic responses occur within seconds to minutes of perception of the initial, local signal, allowing for the rapid deployment of plant-wide responses. For example, an insect starting to chew on just a single leaf triggers preemptive antiherbivore defenses throughout the plant well before it has a chance to move on to the next leaf on its menu.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In addition to microgravity, spaceflight simultaneously exposes biology to a suite of other stimuli. For example, in space, organisms experience ionizing radiation environments that significantly differ in both quality and quantity from those normally experienced on Earth. However, data on radiation exposure during space missions is often complex to access and to understand, limiting progress towards defining how radiation affects organisms against the unique background of spaceflight. To help address this challenge, we have developed the Rad-Bio-App. This web-accessible database imports radiation metadata from experiments archived in NASA’s GeneLab data repository, and then allows the user to explore these experiments both in the context of their radiation exposure and through their other metadata and results. Rad-Bio-App provides an easy-to-use, graphically-driven environment to enable both radiation biologists and non-specialist researchers to visualize, and understand the impact of ionizing radiation on various biological systems in the context of spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: A plant’s oxygen supply can vary from normal (normoxia) to total depletion (anoxia). Tolerance to anoxia is relevant to wetland species, rice (Oryza sativa) cultivation, and submergence tolerance of crops. Decoding and transmitting calcium (Ca) signals may be an important component to anoxia tolerance; however, the contribution of intracellular Ca transporters to this process is poorly understood. Four functional cation/proton exchangers (CAX1–4) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) help regulate Ca homeostasis around the vacuole. Our results demonstrate that cax1 mutants are more tolerant to both anoxic conditions and submergence. Using phenotypic measurements, RNA-sequencing, and proteomic approaches, we identified cax1-mediated anoxia changes that phenocopy changes present in anoxia-tolerant crops: altered metabolic processes, diminished reactive oxygen species production post anoxia, and altered hormone signaling. Comparing wild-type and cax1 expressing genetically encoded Ca indicators demonstrated altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 during reoxygenation. Anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are involved in the control of numerous signaling events related to adaptation to low oxygen stress. This work suggests that cax1 anoxia response pathway could be engineered to circumvent the adverse effects of flooding that impair production agriculture.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight presents a multifaceted environment for plants, combining the effects on growth of many stressors and factors including altered gravity, the influence of experiment hardware, and increased radiation exposure. To help understand the plant response to this complex suite of factors this study compared transcriptomic analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight experiments deposited in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s GeneLab data repository. These data were reanalyzed for genes showing significant differential expression in spaceflight versus ground controls using a single common computational pipeline for either the microarray or the RNA-seq datasets. Such a standardized approach to analysis should greatly increase the robustness of comparisons made between datasets. This analysis was coupled with extensive cross-referencing to a curated matrix of metadata associated with these experiments. Our study reveals that factors such as analysis type (i.e., microarray versus RNA-seq) or environmental and hardware conditions have important confounding effects on comparisons seeking to define plant reactions to spaceflight. The metadata matrix allows selection of studies with high similarity scores, i.e., that share multiple elements of experimental design, such as plant age or flight hardware. Comparisons between these studies then helps reduce the complexity in drawing conclusions arising from comparisons made between experiments with very different designs.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Osteoporosis can profoundly affect the aged as a consequence of progressive bone loss; high-dose ionizing radiation can cause similar changes, although less is known about lower doses (≤100 cGy). We hypothesized that exposure to relatively low doses of gamma radiation accelerates structural changes characteristic of skeletal aging. Mice (C57BL/6J-10 wk old, male) were irradiated (total body; 0-sham, 1, 10 or 100 cGy 137Cs) and tissues harvested on the day of irradiation, 1 or 4 months later. Microcomputed tomography was used to quantify microarchitecture of high turnover, cancellous bone. Irradiation at 100 cGy caused transient microarchitectural changes over one month that were only evident at longer times in controls (4 months). Ex vivo bone cell differentiation from the marrow was unaffected by gamma radiation. In conclusion, acute ionizing gamma irradiation at 100 cGy (but not at 1 cGy or 10 cGy) exacerbated microarchitectural changes normally found during progressive, postpubertal aging prior to the onset of age-related osteoporosis.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, strongly correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1, Csf1, Tnf, and Rankl. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight entails exposure to numerous environmental challenges with the potential to contribute to both musculoskeletal and vascular dysfunction. The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceflight and ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental stresses influence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, are useful for both screening and developing interventions against spaceflight-induced deficits in bone and vascular function.

PARÁGRAFO: The hindlimb unloading (HU) model has been used extensively to simulate the cephalad fluid shift and musculoskeletal disuse observed in spaceflight with its application expanding to study immune, cardiovascular and central nervous system responses, among others. Most HU studies are performed with singly housed animals, although social isolation also can substantially impact behavior and physiology, and therefore may confound HU experimental results. Other HU variants that allow for paired housing have been developed although no systematic assessment has been made to understand the effects of social isolation on HU outcomes. Hence, we aimed to determine the contribution of social isolation to tissue responses to HU. To accomplish this, we developed a refinement to the traditional NASA Ames single housing HU system to accommodate social housing in pairs, retaining desirable features of the original design. We conducted a 30-day HU experiment with adult, female mice that were either singly or socially housed. HU animals in both single and social housing displayed expected musculoskeletal deficits versus housing matched, normally loaded (NL) controls. However, select immune and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responses were differentially impacted by the HU social environment relative to matched NL controls. HU led to a reduction in % CD4+ T cells in singly housed, but not in socially housed mice. Unexpectedly, HU increased adrenal gland mass in socially housed but not singly housed mice, while social isolation increased adrenal gland mass in NL controls. HU also led to elevated plasma corticosterone levels at day 30 in both singly and socially housed mice. Thus, musculoskeletal responses to simulated weightlessness are similar regardless of social environment with a few differences in adrenal and immune responses. Our findings show that combined stressors can mask, not only exacerbate, select responses to HU. These findings further expand the utility of the HU model for studying possible combined effects of spaceflight stressors.

PARÁGRAFO: Animal models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth. For NASA’s Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen in situ for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The mechanisms triggering disuse muscle atrophy remain of debate. It is becoming evident that mitochondrial dysfunction may regulate pathways controlling muscle mass. We have recently shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays a major role in disuse atrophy of soleus, a slow, oxidative muscle. Here we tested the hypothesis that hindlimb unloading-induced atrophy could be due to mitochondrial dysfunction in fast muscles too, notwithstanding their much lower mitochondrial content. Gastrocnemius displayed atrophy following both 3 and 7 days of unloading. SOD1 and catalase up-regulation, no H2O2 accumulation and no increase of protein carbonylation suggest the antioxidant defence system efficiently reacted to redox imbalance in the early phases of disuse. A defective mitochondrial fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1 down-regulation) occurred together with an impairment of OXPHOS capacity. Furthermore, at 3 days of unloading higher acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation was found, suggesting AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation. To test the role of mitochondrial alterations we used Tg-mice overexpressing PGC-1α because of the known effect of PGC-1α on stimulation of Mfn2 expression. PGC-α overexpression was sufficient to prevent (i) the decrease of pro-fusion proteins (Mfn1, Mfn2 and OPA1), (ii) activation of the AMPK pathway, (iii) the inducible expression of MuRF1 and atrogin1 and of authopagic factors, and (iv) any muscle mass loss in response to disuse. As the effects of increased PGC-1α activity were sustained throughout disuse, compounds inducing PGC-1α expression could be useful to treat and prevent muscle atrophy also in fast muscles.

PARÁGRAFO: Isolation on Earth can alter physiology and signaling of organs systems, including the central nervous system. Although not in complete solitude, astronauts operate in an isolated environment during spaceflight. In this study, we determined the effects of isolation and simulated microgravity solely or combined, on the inflammatory cytokine milieu of the hippocampus. Adult female wild-type mice underwent simulated microgravity by hindlimb unloading for 30 days in single or social (paired) housing. In hippocampus, simulated microgravity and isolation each regulate a discrete repertoire of cytokines associated with inflammation. Their combined effects are not additive. A model for mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) quenching via targeted overexpression of the human catalase gene to the mitochondria (MCAT mice), are protected from isolation- and/or simulated microgravity-induced changes in cytokine expression. These findings suggest a key role for mitochondrial ROS signaling in neuroinflammatory responses to spaceflight and prolonged bedrest, isolation, and confinement on Earth.

PARÁGRAFO: N6-threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon–codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1, whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: This study reports on a putative eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway in Drosophila melanogaster and challenges the currently held view that mechanistic routes to synthesize eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipids do not exist in insects, since to date, putative fly homologs of most mammalian enzymes have not been identified. Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D. melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics. Such experimental analysis of eicosanoid biology in a simple model organism will have high relevance to human development and health.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Leptopilina heterotoma are obligate parasitoid wasps that develop in the body of their Drosophila hosts. During oviposition, female wasps introduce venom into the larval hosts’ body cavity. The venom contains discrete, 300 nm-wide, mixed-strategy extracellular vesicles (MSEVs), until recently referred to as virus-like particles. While the crucial immune suppressive functions of L. heterotoma MSEVs have remained undisputed, their biotic nature and origin still remain controversial. In recent proteomics analyses of L. heterotoma MSEVs, we identified 161 proteins in three classes: conserved eukaryotic proteins, infection and immunity related proteins, and proteins without clear annotation. Here we report 246 additional proteins from the L. heterotoma MSEV proteome. An enrichment analysis of the entire proteome supports vesicular nature of these structures. Sequences for more than 90% of these proteins are present in the whole-body transcriptome. Sequencing and de novo assembly of the 460 Mb-sized L. heterotoma genome revealed 90% of MSEV proteins have coding regions within the genomic scaffolds. Altogether, these results explain the stable association of MSEVs with their wasps, and like other wasp structures, their vertical inheritance. While our results do not rule out a viral origin of MSEVs, they suggest that a similar strategy for co-opting cellular machinery for immune suppression may be shared by other wasps to gain advantage over their hosts. These results are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of figitid and related wasp species.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of S. marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space-flown bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type flies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not a major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared flies infected with space-flown bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints spaceflight bacteria grew at a greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L. heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L. heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L. heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L. heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L. heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.

PARÁGRAFO: As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure–function relationships will advance novel drug design.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: During space travel, humans are continuously exposed to two major environmental stresses, microgravity (μG) and space radiation. One of the fundamental questions is whether the two stressors are interactive. For over half a century, many studies were carried out in space, as well as using devices that simulated μG on the ground to investigate gravity effects on cells and organisms, and we have gained insights into how living organisms respond to μG. However, our knowledge on how to assess and manage human health risks in long-term mission to the Moon or Mars is drastically limited. For example, little information is available on how cells respond to simultaneous exposure to space radiation and μG. In this study, we analyzed the frequencies of chromosome aberrations (CA) in cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells exposed to X-ray or carbon ion under the simulated μG conditions. A higher frequency of both simple and complex types of CA were observed in cells exposed to radiation and μG simultaneously compared to CA frequency in cells exposed to radiation only. Our study shows that the dose response data on space radiation obtained at the 1G condition could lead to the underestimation of astronauts’ potential risk for health deterioration, including cancer. This study also emphasizes the importance of obtaining data on the molecular and cellular responses to irradiation under μG conditions.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight is a unique environment with profound effects on biological systems including tissue redistribution and musculoskeletal stresses. However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.

PARÁGRAFO: Baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has broad genetic homology to human cells. Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.

PARÁGRAFO: Understanding genome wide, tissue-specific, and spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures. Transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in space, but not the kidney. We determined the genome wide gene expression using a gene array analysis of kidney and liver tissue from mice flown in space for 12 days versus ground based control animals. By comparing the transcriptome of liver and kidney from animals flown in space versus ground control animals, we tested a unique hypothesis: Are there common gene expression pathways activated in multiple tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli? Although there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas: (a) cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen/organonitrogen compounds; (b) apoptosis and cell death; (c) fat cell differentiation and (d) negative regulation of protein kinase.

PARÁGRAFO: A study was conducted to evaluate the three-dimensional clinostat simulated microgravity effect on mouse models, focusing on the central nervous system. Eighteen mice were divided into three groups: control, survival box, and clinostat + survival box. Behavioral tests, femur micro-CT, brain transcriptomics, serum metabolomics, and fecal microbiomics were performed. Results showed decreased activity, altered gait, enhanced fear memory, bone loss, immune/endocrine changes in brain transcriptome, and altered metabolic pathways in serum and gut microbiota in clinostat-treated mice. The model closely mimics spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes, suggesting its value in studying microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the need for attention to emotional changes in space.

PARÁGRAFO: Increased viscosity of concentrated contrast media (CM) in the renal tubules can perturb renal hemodynamics and have a detrimental effect on tubular epithelial cells. However, the effects of viscosity on contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) remain poorly understood. Conventional in vitro culture studies do not reflect the rheological properties of CM. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CM viscosity on renal tubules using a kidney-on-a-chip and two different types of CM. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were cultured in a three-dimensional microfluidic culture platform under bidirectional fluid shear stress. We treated the RPTEC with two types of CM: low- (LOCM, iopromide) and iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM, iodixanol). Renal tubular cell injury induced by LOCM and IOCM was examined under different iodine concentrations (50–250 mgI/mL) and shear-stress conditions. LOCM showed a significant dose-dependent cytotoxic effect, which was significantly higher than that of IOCM under static and low-to-moderate shear stress conditions. However, high shear-stress resulted in reduced cell viability in IOCM; no difference between IOCM and LOCM was found under high shear-stress conditions. The cytotoxic effects were pronounced at a mean shear stress of 1 dyn/cm2 or higher. The high viscosity of IOCM slowed the fluid flow rate and augmented fluid shear-stress. We suggest an alternative in vitro model of CIN using the three-dimensional kidney-on-a-chip. Our results indicate a vital role of viscosity-induced nephrotoxicity under high shear-stress conditions, contrary to the findings of conventional in vitro studies.

PARÁGRAFO: Bone remodeling may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the space flight (SF) group compared to the ground control (GC) group – the mean ± SD for SF group was 10.48 ± 0.47 %, compared to 9.64 ± 0.79 % for GC group (p<0.05). CsTh demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ±0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ±0.005 mm in the SF group (p=0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ±0.029 g/cc for GC and 0.893 ± 0.028 g/cc for SF (p=0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes adaptive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight. These findings suggest that fluid shifts alone accompanying microgravity may initiate bone remodeling independent of skeletal loading by tissue.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Intervertebral disc herniation rates are quadrupled in astronauts following spaceflight. While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (μCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.

PARÁGRAFO: Astronauts suffer from a loss of bone mass at a rate of 1.5% per month from lower regions of the body during the course of long-duration (>30 days) spaceflight, a phenomenon that poses important risks for returning crew. Conversely, a gain in bone mass may occur in non-load bearing regions of the body as related to microgravity-induced cephalad fluid shift. Representing non-load bearing regions with mouse calvaria and leveraging the STS-131 (15-day) and BION-M1 (30-day) flights, we examined spatial and temporal calvarial vascular remodeling and gene expression related to microgravity exposure compared between spaceflight (SF) and ground control (GC) cohorts. We examined parasagittal capillary numbers and structures in calvaria from 16 to 23 week-old C57BL/6 female mice (GC, n = 4; SF, n = 5) from STS-131 and 19–20 week-old C57BL/6 male mice (GC, n = 6; SF, n = 6) from BION-M1 using a robust isolectin-IB4 vessel marker. We found that the vessel diameter reduces significantly in mice exposed to 15 days of spaceflight relative to control. Capillarization increases by 30% (SF vs. GC, p = 0.054) in SF mice compared to GC mice. The vessel numbers and diameter remain unchanged in BION-M1 mice calvarial section. We next analyzed the parietal pro-angiogenic (VEGFA) and pro-osteogenic gene (BMP-2, DMP1, RUNX2 and OCN) expression in BION-M1 mice using quantitative RT-PCR. VEGFA gene expression increased 15-fold while BMP-2 gene expression increased 11-fold in flight mice compared to GC. The linkage between vascular morphology and gene expression in the SF conditions suggests that angiogenesis may be important in the regulation of pathological bone growth in non-weight bearing regions of the body. Short-duration microgravity-mediated bone restructuring has implications in planning effective countermeasures for long-duration flights and extraterrestrial human habitation.

PARÁGRAFO: Waterborne pathogenic mycobacteria can form biofilms, and certain species can cause hard-to-treat human lung infections. Astronaut health could therefore be compromised if the spacecraft environment or water becomes contaminated with pathogenic mycobacteria. This work uses Mycobacterium marinum to determine the physiological changes in a pathogenic mycobacteria grown under low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG). M. marinum were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) using a rotary cell culture system subjected to LSMMG or the control orientation (normal gravity, NG) and the cultures used to determine bacterial growth, bacterium size, transcriptome changes, and resistance to stress. Two exposure times to LSMMG and NG were examined: bacteria were grown for ~40 h (short), or 4 days followed by re-dilution and growth for ~35 h (long). M. marinum exposed to LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier than the NG culture. They were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide but showed no change in resistance to gamma radiation or pH 3.5. RNA-Seq detected significantly altered transcript levels for 562 and 328 genes under LSMMG after short and long exposure times, respectively. Results suggest that LSMMG induced a reduction in translation, a downregulation of metabolism, an increase in lipid degradation, and increased chaperone and mycobactin expression. Sigma factor H (sigH) was the only sigma factor transcript induced by LSMMG after both short and long exposure times. In summary, transcriptome studies suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment similar to that found within macrophage during infection. SigH is also implicated in the M. marinum LSMMG transcriptome response.

PARÁGRAFO: Gravitropism describes curvature of plants in response to gravity or differential acceleration and clinorotation is commonly used to compensate unilateral effect of gravity. We report on experiments that examine the persistence of the gravity signal and separate mechanostimulation from gravistimulation. Flax roots were reoriented (placed horizontally for 5, 10 or 15 min) and clinorotated at a rate of 0.5 to 5 rpm either vertically (parallel to the gravity vector and root axis) or horizontally (perpendicular to the gravity vector and parallel to the root axis). Image sequences showed that horizontal clinorotation did not affect root growth rate (0.81 ± 0.03 mm h−1) but vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by about 7%. The angular velocity (speed of clinorotation) did not affect growth for either direction. However, maximal curvature for vertical clinorotation decreased with increasing rate of rotation and produced straight roots at 5 rpm. In contrast, horizontal clinorotation increased curvature with increasing angular velocity. The point of maximal curvature was used to determine the longevity (memory) of the gravity signal, which lasted about 120 min. The data indicate that mechanostimulation modifies the magnitude of the graviresponse but does not affect memory persistence.

PARÁGRAFO: The significant horticultural crop, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) is vulnerable to the excessive salt concentration in the soil, which contributes to its scaled-down growth and productivity, among other indices. The current study examines the efficacy of hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming on the physio-biochemical attributes and tolerance to salinity (100 mM NaCl) in cauliflower under controlled conditions. The results showed that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.

PARÁGRAFO: Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Qy when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds.

PARÁGRAFO: Unlike typical negative gravitropic curvature, young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 (UBQ1) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.

PARÁGRAFO: Directing plant growth in weightlessness requires understanding the processes that establish plant orientation and how to manipulate them. Both gravi- and phototropism determine directional growth and previous experiments showed that high gradient magnetic fields (HGMF) can induce curvature in roots and shoots. Experiments with Brassica rapa verified that that gravitropism-like induction of curvature is possible in space and that the HGMF-responsive organelles are amyloplasts. We assessed the effect of space and HGMF based on 16 genes and compared their transcription with static growth and clinorotation. Amyloplasts size in root tips increased under weightlessness but decreased under clinorotation but not in response to magnetic fields. Amyloplast size changes were correlated with reduced amylase transcription in space samples and enhanced transcription after clinorotation. Mechanostimulation and weightlessness have opposite effects on the size of amyloplasts. The data show that plants perceive weightlessness, and that their metabolism adjusts to microgravity and mechanostimulation. Thus, clinorotation as surrogate for space research may lead to incorrect interpretations.

PARÁGRAFO: The necessity to include plants as a component of a Bioregenerative Life Support System leads to investigations to optimize plant growth facilities as well as a better understanding of the plant cell membrane and its numerous activities in the signaling, transport, and sensing of gravity, drought, and other stressors. The cell membrane participates in numerous processes, including endo- and exocytosis and cell division, and is involved in the response to external stimuli. Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The composition, especially the sterol-dependent recruitment of specific proteins affects endo- and exo-membrane domains as well as plasmodesmata. The enhanced saturated fatty acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical stress. These results can also be obtained with lipid-sensitive stains. The linkage of the CM to the cytoskeleton via rafts is part of the complex interactions between lipid microdomains, mechanosensitive ion channels, and the organization of the cytoskeleton. These intricately linked structures and functions provide multiple future research directions to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in physiological processes.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Like many other organisms, plants are capable of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli such as touch, osmotic pressure, and gravity. One mechanism for the perception of force is the activation of mechanosensitive (or stretch-activated) ion channels, and a number of mechanosensitive channel activities have been described in plant membranes. Based on their homology to the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS, the 10 MscS-Like (MSL) proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana have been hypothesized to form mechanosensitive channels in plant cell and organelle membranes. However, definitive proof that MSLs form mechanosensitive channels has been lacking. Here we used single-channel patch clamp electrophysiology to show that MSL10 is capable of providing a MS channel activity when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. This channel had a conductance of ∼100 pS, consistent with the hypothesis that it underlies an activity previously observed in the plasma membrane of plant root cells. We found that MSL10 formed a channel with a moderate preference for anions, which was modulated by strongly positive and negative membrane potentials, and was reversibly inhibited by gadolinium, a known inhibitor of mechanosensitive channels. MSL10 demonstrated asymmetric activation/inactivation kinetics, with the channel closing at substantially lower tensions than channel opening. The electrophysiological characterization of MSL10 reported here provides insight into the evolution of structure and function of this important family of proteins.

PARÁGRAFO: Somatosensory neurons mediate responses to diverse mechanical stimuli, from innocuous touch to noxious pain. While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.

PARÁGRAFO: The oocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) comprise one of the most widely used membrane protein expression systems. While frequently used for studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked, perhaps due to a relative abundance of native expression systems. Recent advances, however, have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes.

PARÁGRAFO: Cell viability and metabolism depend on cytoplasmic water and solute content, and organisms have evolved mechanisms to sense changes in cell water content, solute concentrations, cell volume, and/or turgor. This Perspective addresses the response to osmotic challenge in land plants and describes their special dependence on cellular water status for growth and development. Understanding how plants cope with water limitation may allow us to mitigate the agricultural effects of drought, a critical limitation on global crop productivity that is likely to increase in severity as the climate changes (Long and Ort, 2010). The signaling pathways by which plants respond to osmotic challenge are intriguing from an evolutionary standpoint: some aspects of these pathways resemble those of fungal or mammalian cells, some are similar to prokaryotic mechanisms, and yet others are unique to plants (as described below and in Hamann, 2012). In addition to the importance of osmotic homeostasis in land plants, we will discuss some of the specific context and language of plant stress biology, and describe what is known (and not known) about the molecular pathways by which plants sense and respond to osmotic challenges.
PARÁGRAFO: Plants can only take up water from the soil in which they are growing, and are unable to relocate to find more favorable water conditions. The majority of the water extracted from the soil by a plant’s roots travels rapidly up the plant through the vascular system, eventually to be lost via regulated pores in the leaf epidermis called stomata. This vertical movement of water within the plant mediates the root-to-shoot movement of nutrients, hormones, and developmental signals. Importantly, open stomata are also the conduits through which gas is exchanged between the leaf and the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Thus, plants must continuously balance the advantages of efficient photosynthesis and solute transport with the drawbacks of water loss through open stomata; how well they accomplish this task contributes to their water use efficiency, a key factor in drought response (Long and Ort, 2010).
PARÁGRAFO: At the cellular level, water is critical for maintaining and controlling an important driving force in plant cells called turgor pressure. Much of a plant cell’s water—and therefore most of its volume—is accounted for by the vacuole (a large intracellular organelle found in plants, fungi, and animals). In plants, the vacuole often takes up >80% of the cell volume, and one of its many functions is to maintain turgor via active transport of ions in and out of the vacuolar space (Hedrich, 2012). The plant cell plasma membrane is surrounded by a strong but elastic cell wall comprised of cellulose microfibrils embedded in a gel of pectin, other carbohydrates, and protein. Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by the protoplast (all portions of the cell enclosed by the plasma membrane) against the cell wall. The amount of turgor pressure in a particular cell is determined by several factors, including the osmotic difference that is generated by vacuolar and cytoplasmic solute accumulation and subsequent water uptake, and the elasticity of the cell wall (see Verslues et al., 2006, for additional explanation). The turgor pressure of a plant cell can be as high as the pressure of a car tire; high turgor pressure is critical to give plants their rigidity and structure, drive cell expansion, mediate the opening and closing of stomata, and allow movements like the closing of a Venus flytrap (Pritchard, 2001).
PARÁGRAFO: Strictly defined, the term “osmosensing” refers to the direct perception of the osmolarity of the external or internal environment of a cell. This term is often used by plant researchers, but it is entirely possible that mechanical stimuli caused by change in membrane tension, cell wall damage, or the disruption of plasma membrane–cell wall connections are relevant factors in osmosensing, in addition to or instead of altered extracellular osmolarity per se (see Fig. 1). For the purposes of this Perspective, “osmosensing” is used to include both the direct perception of osmotic imbalance across a membrane as well as the perception of indirect effects of osmotic imbalance on the membrane, cell wall, or membrane–cell wall system. We anticipate that as the molecular mechanism(s) for the perception of osmotic challenge becomes clearer, so will the terms used to describe these processes.
PARÁGRAFO: Potential osmosensing mechanisms in plant cells. (A) Histidine kinases could be activated by osmotic imbalance across the plasma membrane, initiating a signal transduction pathway similar to the high osmolarity glycerol response 1 pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (B) Ion channels that are opened in response to planar membrane tension or membrane bending could respond to both protoplast swelling or shrinking. The release of ions in response to hypoosmotic swelling would be similar to the MscS/MscL “osmotic release valve” paradigm in Escherichia coli. In addition, the entry of Ca2+ through an opened MS ion channel could have downstream signaling properties. (C) Cell wall integrity-monitoring mechanisms could involve receptor-like kinases with extracellular domains capable of sensing the movement or disruption of cell wall components. The cell wall is presented as a gray box. The plasma membrane is represented as a bilayer of gray lipid molecules.
PARÁGRAFO: Plant water status is typically described in terms of “water potential,” a measure of the free energy status of water relative to pure water at a reference state. Water potential is derived from the chemical potential of water but is expressed in units of pressure, which makes it particularly useful in plant biology as a unified measure of soil and plant water status. Factors that decrease the free energy of water (such as increased concentration of dissolved solutes or adhesion to hydrophilic surfaces such as soil particles) make the water potential more negative, whereas factors that increase the free energy (such as increased turgor pressure) make the water potential more positive. Additional details of water potential can be found in Boyer and Kramer (1995) and Verslues et al. (2006). The measurement of water potentials allows for simple predictions regarding the direction of water fluxes and changes in turgor (Boyer and Kramer, 1995). Water potentials of 0 to −0.3 megapascals (MPa) are typical of well-watered plants, whereas water potentials of −1.5 to −2.0 MPa represent severe stress and permanent loss of turgor for many plants including most crop species and the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, drought-adapted plants such as those found in deserts can grow at much lower water potentials, and both inter- and intra-species variation are emerging as important tools in understanding plant osmosensing mechanisms and adaptation to dry environments.
PARÁGRAFO: The term “hyperosmotic stress” is infrequently used in plant biology. This is because water limitation is rarely caused by the presence of high levels of extracellular solutes but is more often created by the unavailability of water (quantified as a decrease in water potential). The downstream effects of water limitation on plants that are commonly assayed include: the accumulation of compatible solutes such as proline, the induction of protective proteins such as dehydrins, the production of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), and increased sensitivity to ABA treatment in physiological assays (Verslues and Juenger, 2011; Christmann et al., 2013). An illustration of the relevance of distinguishing between hyperosmotic stress and low water availability comes from simple treatments with extracellular solutions. Treating plants with a solution of low molecular weight solutes such as NaCl will plasmolyze cells (a shrinking of the protoplast leading to its separation from the cell wall), whereas soil drying or treatment with large polymers that cannot penetrate the cell wall (such as PEG) will cause cytorrhysis (shrinking of both protoplast and cell wall). These two types of treatment elicit very different downstream responses and may in fact be perceived by different mechanisms. For example, root growth rate is much higher after cytorrhytic than plasmolytic treatments of the same MPa (Verslues et al., 2006). Furthermore, cytorrhysis and plasmolysis can have different effects on plasma membrane–cell wall connections (perhaps analogous to the effects of osmotic stress on focal adhesion complexes in mammalian cells; see below for further discussion), which in turn elicit different downstream signaling events.
PARÁGRAFO: Plants experience water stress when the water content, and therefore the water potential, of the soil decreases. In addition, plants growing in hot dry air can become dehydrated, even when the soil is relatively wet, if water cannot be taken up rapidly enough by the roots to compensate for the water lost through stomata. Many plants regularly lose turgor during the day when the humidity of the environment is low relative to that inside the leaf, and stomates are open to support photosynthesis. They then rehydrate during the night when environmental humidity is high and stomates are closed. In the laboratory, drought/water stress is imposed by withholding water from potted plants or by transferring plants to media with defined water potential (Verslues et al., 2006).
PARÁGRAFO: Hypoosmotic stress may occur transiently when dry soil is rapidly rewetted, and chronically upon repeated soil flooding. In the laboratory, hypoosmotic stress is typically reproduced by treating isolated cells with solutions of distilled water after equilibration in high levels of NaCl or mannitol. The phenomenon of water soaking, the accumulation of intercellular water during pathogenic invasion, promotes pathogen survival and may impose hypoosmotic stress on surrounding cells (Beattie, 2011). In addition, some stages of plant development necessarily involve osmotic challenges, including the desiccation of seeds and pollen and their subsequent rehydration and resumption of metabolic activity. It is also possible, though not yet demonstrated, that the cell wall weakening associated with cell expansion during normal plant growth may have some of the same effects as hypoosmotic stress.
PARÁGRAFO: It is not fully known how plants initially sense any of the osmotic challenges described above. Three general models for osmosensing in plant cells are illustrated in Fig. 1. Below, we further describe the molecular mechanisms thought to underlie each of these molecular models and summarize the supporting experimental evidence.
PARÁGRAFO: In theory, a protein embedded in the plasma membrane could directly sense changes in osmolarity outside the cell, perhaps via an osmotically regulated conformational change in an extracellular domain (Fig. 1 A; Parsegian et al., 1995). However, there is currently little experimental support for this model in any eukaryotic system (interested readers are directed to the accompanying discussion of prokaryotic osmosensors in the Perspective by Wood). Several osmosensors involved in hyperosmotic signaling through the Saccharomyces cerevisiae high osmolarity glycerol response (HOG)1 pathway, including the histidine kinase Synthetic Lethal of N-end rule 1 (SLN1), were originally proposed to function in this manner, but recent data suggest that one or more of the other mechanisms listed below may instead be involved (Saito and Posas, 2012). Plant homologues of SLN1 have been reported to serve as regulators of water stress responses (Tran et al., 2007; Wohlbach et al., 2008). However, other data have raised questions as to whether these kinases could be the main plant osmosensing system, as loss-of-function alleles have limited effects on key phenotypes such as the accumulation of ABA and osmoregulatory solutes (Kumar et al., 2013). Alternatively, a novel calcium channel, REDUCED HYPEROSMOLARITY-INDUCED [Ca2+]i INCREASE (OSCA)1, has recently been reported to be activated by hyperosmolarity and to be genetically required for several stress-related phenotypes (Hou et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2014); additional physiological experiments are needed to fully understand the role of OSCA1 and related channels in drought response.
PARÁGRAFO: It is easy to imagine how hypoosmotic shock leads to increased plasma membrane tension; dehydration may have the same effect in plant cells because the plant plasma membrane and cell wall are physically linked at multiple locations. Upon plasmolysis, most of the protoplast separates from the cell wall, but thin strands of plasma membrane (Hechtian strands) remain connected. As a result, both shrinking and swelling of the protoplast could increase plasma membrane tension.
PARÁGRAFO: Mechanosensitive (MS) channels are capable of sensing membrane tension and responding to it by facilitating the flux of osmolytes across the membrane (Fig. 1 B). Multiple families of MS ion channels have been identified in plant genomes, and numerous MS ion channel activities have been detected in plant membranes (Monshausen and Haswell, 2013). The MID1-COMPLEMENTING ACTIVITY (MCA) proteins, a family of putative MS ion channels, promote Ca2+ influx in response to hypoosmotic shock and mechanical stimulus in several plant species (Kurusu et al., 2013). Although no defect in the response to hypoosmotic shock or water deficit has been reported in mca mutants, Arabidopsis MCA1 is required for a normal response to cell wall damage and for efficient root growth into a hard agar medium (Hamann, 2012; Kurusu et al., 2013). Members of two other MS ion channel families, the MscS-Like (MSL) channels and the Two-Pore K+ (TPK) channels, function in organelles (see below). An osmosensing function for plasma membrane–localized MSL or TPK channels has yet to be thoroughly investigated.
PARÁGRAFO: The cell wall–plasma membrane interface is a critical site for detecting stimuli generated by changing water status. The Hechtian strands described above are reminiscent of focal adhesions of mammalian cells and, like focal adhesions, can be disrupted by treatment with peptides that harbor the amino acid motif RGD (Canut et al., 1998). This has led to the hypothesis that focal adhesion–like complexes may exist in plants and serve to sense alterations in plasma membrane–cell wall attachments caused by dehydration. Although direct orthologues of mammalian proteins such as integrins have not been found in plants, molecular modeling has uncovered an Arabidopsis protein with an integrin-like structure that may play a role in osmoregulation (Knepper et al., 2011).
PARÁGRAFO: Alternatively, plant osmosensing might bear similarities to cell wall monitoring mechanisms in yeast (Hamann, 2012; Monshausen and Haswell, 2013). An osmosensor could bind directly to cell wall proteins, or mechanical change or cell wall damage could cause the release of specific molecules that are perceived by the osmosensor (Fig. 1 C). More than 600 receptor-like kinases are encoded by the Arabidopsis genome, and it is thought that some of these have drought signaling functions (Marshall et al., 2012). For example, THESEUS and FERONIA have lectin-like extracellular domains that may monitor cell wall status by binding directly to cell wall–derived carbohydrates or glycoproteins (Cheung and Wu, 2011). Another family of receptor-like kinases implicated in cell wall integrity is the Wall-Associated Kinase family (Kohorn and Kohorn, 2012). Genetic and biochemical studies support a model wherein Wall-Associated Kinases bind pectin, a component of the plant cell wall, and subsequently serve to control cell expansion through an unknown signal transduction pathway.
PARÁGRAFO: Vacuoles and plastids take up a substantial portion of plant cell volume, and the osmotic status of these compartments must be coordinated with that of the cytoplasm. Thus, the plasma membrane–based mechanisms described above are likely to be accompanied by an analogous osmosensing system in vacuolar and organellar membranes. However, little is known about these processes. The disruption of two plastid MSL channels constitutively activates low water potential responses, including ABA production and sensitivity, proline biosynthesis, and solute accumulation (Wilson et al., 2014). Vacuole membrane–localized members of the TPK family were recently shown to be modulated by membrane tension and might serve a similar role (Maathuis, 2011). Thus, although MS channels have traditionally been associated with protection from extracellular hypoosmotic shock, they are also important in coordinating the osmotic status of intracellular compartments and have an as yet undefined connection to physiological mechanisms important to low water potential response.
PARÁGRAFO: Downstream osmotic stress signaling pathways have received a great deal more attention than the initial perception of water deficit. Interestingly, stress-responsive solute accumulation in plant cells may share some mechanisms with solute accumulation in bacterial cells (see accompanying Perspective by Wood). Other responses, such as the induction of protective proteins and stress-regulated gene expression, appear to involve plant-specific mechanisms, some of which depend on stress-induced increases in ABA levels (Yoshida et al., 2014).
PARÁGRAFO: Many studies have characterized the extensive changes in intracellular calcium, transcriptional regulation, epigenetic modification, and posttranslational protein modification (especially phosphorylation) that occur in plants in response to hyperosmolarity, water limitation, and ABA (Verslues and Juenger, 2011; Christmann et al., 2013). In addition, the molecular mechanisms of ABA perception are now known in detail (Cutler et al., 2010). Although some of the genes induced or proteins modified in response to water limitation have clear roles in signaling, the synthesis or import of specific solutes and ions, or protection against reactive oxygen species, the functions of many other stress-induced genes are less clear. A great deal of transcriptomic and proteomic data is being generated, but these data can be challenging to interpret because of the difficulty in distinguishing ABA-dependent signaling events from events that are directly related to osmosensing or mechanosensing. For example, several members of the SnRK2 family of plant-specific kinases are key players in ABA signaling and can be activated by exogenous ABA in the absence of osmotic stress. However, other SnRK2s cannot be activated by ABA but can still be rapidly activated by osmotic stress (Boudsocq et al., 2007). How activation of these latter SnRK2s is connected to osmotic stress is not known. Even the key downstream responses—ABA accumulation, the accumulation of protective solutes, and the induction of protective proteins—have not been definitively linked to signaling chains that lead all the way back to the initial perception of water limitation.
PARÁGRAFO: Many of the mechanisms described above are also likely to be involved in hypoosmotic signaling, but more research is needed to establish the precise nature of the pathway and identify the critical components. Hypoosmotic stress administered to plant cells in suspension cultures elicits a rapid oxidative burst that depends on a phosphorylation cascade involving Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase and/or Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase activation (Cazale et al., 1999; Romeis et al., 2001). The pathway is proposed to induce anion efflux, which is the driving force of osmoregulation in guard cells, but the molecular mechanism has not been determined.
PARÁGRAFO: Despite our strong motivation to understand plant osmosensing and signaling, plant scientists still have a great deal of work to do. Key goals for future investigation include: (a) determining the molecular identity of the osmosensing apparatus, as detailed here and illustrated in Fig. 1; (b) characterizing the nature of the osmotic stress response signaling pathways upstream of the phytohormone ABA and distinguishing it from responses to other abiotic stresses; and (c) using a wider range of assays in genetic screens to include the full range of phenotypes relevant for plant adaptation to water-limited environments.
PARÁGRAFO: With regard to conclusively identifying plant osmosensors, the primary limitation at the moment is that no candidate osmosensors have been conclusively linked to stress signaling and key stress phenotypes. This bottleneck can be explained in part by redundancy; something as critical to plant life as monitoring and responding to water status probably involves multiple mechanisms. As described above, testing candidate genes that are homologues of known osmosensors in other systems is a start, but it will also be important to leverage the power of forward molecular genetic screens in Arabidopsis. For this to take place, phenotypic assays that are amenable to high throughput analysis and that either measure the primary stimulus of osmotic challenge or measure downstream responses directly regulated by osmosensors are needed. A promising recent approach taken by several laboratories is to directly screen for altered calcium fluxes in response to osmotic stress (for example, Yuan et al., 2014). Natural variation and genome-wide association analysis also provide new and promising ways to find key genes that may be difficult to discover by classic forward or reverse genetic screens (Verslues et al., 2014).
PARÁGRAFO: In addition, new tools that would allow one to measure osmolyte movement, ion flux, membrane tension, or turgor in the proper cell biological context and in a noninvasive manner would likely be transformative for the field. Finally, the cytoskeleton is intricately involved in force sensing and controlling cell shape in mammalian cells (see accompanying Perspective by Sachs and Sivaselvan) and is likely to have as-yet-undiscovered roles in the perception and signaling of osmotic stress in plants (in addition to controlling cell wall deposition and other properties). We anticipate that future work on all of these fronts from many laboratories will reveal the ways in which plant osmosensing is similar to osmosensing in other systems, and the ways in which it is unique to plants.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The balance between proliferation and differentiation in the plant shoot apical meristem is controlled by regulatory loops involving the phytohormone cytokinin and stem cell identity genes. Concurrently, cellular differentiation in the developing shoot is coordinated with the environmental and developmental status of plastids within those cells. Here, we employ an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant exhibiting constitutive plastid osmotic stress to investigate the molecular and genetic pathways connecting plastid osmotic stress with cell differentiation at the shoot apex. msl2 msl3 mutants exhibit dramatically enlarged and deformed plastids in the shoot apical meristem, and develop a mass of callus tissue at the shoot apex. Callus production in this mutant requires the cytokinin receptor AHK2 and is characterized by increased cytokinin levels, downregulation of cytokinin signaling inhibitors ARR7 and ARR15, and induction of the stem cell identity gene WUSCHEL. Furthermore, plastid stress-induced apical callus production requires elevated plastidic reactive oxygen species, ABA biosynthesis, the retrograde signaling protein GUN1, and ABI4. These results are consistent with a model wherein the cytokinin/WUS pathway and retrograde signaling control cell differentiation at the shoot apex.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Exposure to the microgravity conditions of spaceflight alleviates the load normally imposed by the Earth’s gravitational field on the inner ear utricular epithelia. Previous ultrastructural investigations have shown that spaceflight induces an increase in synapse density within hair cells of the rat utricle. However, the utricle exhibits broad physiological heterogeneity across different epithelial regions, and it is unknown whether capabilities for synaptic plasticity generalize to hair cells across its topography. To achieve systematic and broader sampling of the epithelium than was previously conducted, we used immunohistochemistry and volumetric image analyses to quantify synapse distributions across representative utricular regions in specimens from mice exposed to spaceflight (a 15-day mission of the space shuttle Discovery). These measures were compared with similarly sampled Earth-bound controls. Following paraformaldehyde fixation and microdissection, immunohistochemistry was performed on intact specimens to label presynaptic ribbons (anti-CtBP2) and postsynaptic receptor complexes (anti-Shank1A). Synapses were identified as closely apposed pre- and postsynaptic puncta. Epithelia from horizontal semicircular canal cristae served as “within-specimen” controls, whereas utricles and cristae from Earth-bound cohorts served as experimental controls. We found that synapse densities decreased in the medial extrastriolae of microgravity specimens compared with experimental controls, whereas they were unchanged in the striolae and horizontal cristae from the two conditions. These data demonstrate that structural plasticity was topographically localized to the utricular region that encodes very low frequency and static changes in linear acceleration, and illuminates the remarkable capabilities of utricular hair cells for synaptic plasticity in adapting to novel gravitational environments.
PARÁGRAFO: NEW & NOTEWORTHY Spaceflight imposes a radically different sensory environment from that in which the inner ear utricle normally operates. We investigated synaptic modifications in utricles from mice flown aboard a space shuttle mission. Structural synaptic plasticity was detected in the medial extrastriola, a region associated with encoding static head position, as decreased synapse density. These results are remarkably congruent with a recent report of decreased utricular function in astronauts immediately after returning from the International Space Station.

PARÁGRAFO: The early writings of Jules Verne (From the Earth to the Moon, 1865; Fig. 1) and H. G. Wells (First Men on the Moon, 1901; Fig. 2) were the starting point of science fiction and the dream of space exploration. Verne proposed a “projectile bullet capsule” shot from a long cannon named Columbiad as a means for 3 explorers to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave Earth's gravity (1). Even in 1865 there were concerns about humans' ability to survive extreme velocities. Verne made crude calculations on the length of cannon needed for a human to survive a launch to the moon. Almost 100 yrs later, the United States used a very similarly shaped Apollo capsule named Columbia to take 3 astronauts—Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin—to the moon and return to Earth.

PARÁGRAFO: The vision of spaceflight began with science fiction literature, which was followed decades later by the science, engineering and other technological achievements that made it a reality. It took the momentum of war to further advance technology to a point where space travel was possible. After World War II, the United States and the USSR repurposed the spoils of war, transforming the once terrorizing German V-2 rocket program into new space programs. Some vehicles are specifically designed for suborbital (ballistic) flight; examples include crewed vehicles, such as the X-15 rocket plane, sounding rockets, and Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, and uncrewed rockets, such as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).
PARÁGRAFO: The first spaceflight was ballistic and reached an altitude of 17 nautical miles (31.5 km) above the earth. Ballistic flights, by definition, do not go into orbit and have only brief periods of microgravity (10−3 to 10−6 g). During ballistic flights, spaceflight microgravity lasts from a few seconds or minutes to a few hours before returning to the planet. This type of flight only offers short opportunities for scientific query.
PARÁGRAFO: Orbital flights travel at ∼17,500 nautical miles per hour (∼32,400 km/h) around the planet and are on a different scale of experimental time since microgravity can last from days, weeks, and months to years. Orbital flights support a wide range of science investigations from signal transduction and gene expression to differentiation, physiology, and development. The height of the orbit around Earth depends on the spaceship: the shuttle orbited at ∼160 nautical miles (∼300 km), whereas the International Space Station (ISS) is in a near-circular orbit at ∼192 nautical miles (∼360 km). The U.S. military and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) award astronaut flight medals to crew members that fly ≥50 nautical miles above the earth. With the exception of the X-15 rocket plane and early Mercury flyers, most astronauts accomplished their required altitude on orbital flights.
PARÁGRAFO: With the flight of the first human-made object into orbit on October 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 started the intense competition between the USSR and the United States, vying for the number-one spot in the Space Race. To determine whether animals could survive launch forces, both countries flew animals to test the sustainability of life during spaceflight and started the fields of gravitational and space biology. Nikita Khrushchev ordered the first orbital spaceflight of an animal after the successful flight of Sputnik 1. He wanted to have a spectacular launch on November 7, 1957, the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. In response to his request, Soviet planners and engineers came up with an orbital flight with a dog onboard. A stray, Laikia (Fig. 3), was picked to be the first dog in space because of her survival skills on the snowy streets of Moscow. Unfortunately, in the rush to make the deadline, there was no time to plan a sustainable environmental system or a reentry plan. Laikia, the first Earth being to orbit the planet, did not survive her flight.

PARÁGRAFO: Later spaceflights were used to study the effect of microgravity on living systems and the requirement of gravity for normal function of the body's systems. The Apollo missions were the first to show significant changes in multiple biological systems in spaceflight. These changes included vestibular disturbances, in-flight cardiac arrhythmia, reduced postflight orthostatic tolerance, postflight dehydration, and weight loss. Scientists also found a significant decrease in red blood cell mass (RBCM). Other major changes documented were the negative in-flight balance for nitrogen and a significant loss of calcium and bone (2–5).
PARÁGRAFO: These observations helped guide NASA scientists to plan more detailed physiological studies during the Skylab era (1973–1974; Fig. 4). During the Skylab missions, scientists conducted the first detailed metabolic and immune studies. When Skylab crew members were tested for osteoporosis in the os calcis (the largest bone of the heel), bone loss was only apparent on the longer Skylab missions (5).
PARÁGRAFO: Skylab 3 (1973–1974), the first NASA space station. Image courtesy NASA.
PARÁGRAFO: It was on the Skylab missions that the significant changes in the immune function were first studied in detail. Lymphocytes from the flight crew and the backup crew were tested for phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated growth preflight, on landing and then again 13 d later. There were no significant changes seen in immune response in the backup crew; however, the vast majority of the response of the T cell was lost in the flight crew on return to Earth. Immune function did not return until 13 d later (6). Skylab experiments also showed the benefits of vigorous exercise as a countermeasure to minimize cardiovascular deconditioning.
PARÁGRAFO: The Skylab 4 mission was the first to study the occurrence of visual light flashes that had first been noted on Apollo 11. One astronaut counted a total of 168 flashes over 2 sessions. It was thought that the flashes seen after dark adaptation were due to ionization energy loss as a particle traversed retinal cells (7). On my flight in 1991, we were told that there was a solar flare; after I closed my eyes that night, I remember watching brilliant flashes of light—I fell to sleep before my count got to 20.
PARÁGRAFO: In 1991, NASA flew the first dedicated medical mission, designated as Spacelab Life Sciences-1 (STS-40). The crew consisted of 7 members: 3 orbiter astronauts and 4 payload astronauts. The mission was designed to study the cause of the physiological changes that were previously observed during Apollo, Skylab, and the USSR programs. The physiological space adaptations discussed here are fluid shift (due to the lack of gravity pulling fluid the lower body) and space anemia (the loss of RBCM); space osteoporosis and loss of calcium; and immunosuppression in space.
PARÁGRAFO: During spaceflight, the volume in the lower limbs decreases by ∼10% due to a 1- to 2-L fluid shift from the legs to the upper body. The facial fullness and puffy appearance of the head and reduced volume in the lower limbs is referred to as “puffy face-bird leg” syndrome (8). Space studies of plasma volume showed a 22% decrease from the average plasma volume taken from preflight data. This loss of plasma volume occurred by d 2 of flight even though the crew was diligent in keeping a high state of hydration. On d 8 of flight, there was still a 12% decrease in plasma volume, and it took 6 d after landing for the crew's plasma volume to return to preflight levels. The reduction of plasma volume during spaceflight is most likely a result of the fluid shift that is sensed by the body and results in an increased diuresis (9). When plasma volume was reduced, there was a dramatic decrease in erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein made in the renal cortex.
PARÁGRAFO: The study of the influence of spaceflight on the erythrokinetics in humans was found to be caused by the reduced plasma EPO that, in turn, affected various hormones, such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). ANP was reduced by 20% from d 1 of flight, with the nadir of ∼60% on d 8 of flight (10–13). The levels of serum ANP did not return to normal until 6 d after landing. Serum EPO levels decreased ∼40% by d 2 of flight and remained depressed until the day after landing, at which time it rebounded almost 2-fold compared to the preflight baseline levels.
PARÁGRAFO: Alfrey et al. (11) found that RBC survival was reduced during spaceflight by apoptosis of RBCs due to insufficient sera levels of EPO during spaceflight. After this breakthrough finding from his space experiments, Alfrey continued studies of RBC regulation and has shown that red cell mass is decreased when the sera level of EPO is suppressed. This leads to the selective hemolysis of the youngest circulating RBCs, called neocytes. The process is now called neocytolysis and has been confirmed with a variety of physiological and pathophysiologic situations, including descent of high-altitude dwellers to sea level, the anemia in renal failure, and in a human model based on EPO administration and withdrawal (13–18).
PARÁGRAFO: Bone loss was also well documented on the Apollo and Skylab missions. Osteoporosis is currently one of the most serious health hazards of long-term spaceflight. There is continuous and progressive loss of calcium and weight-bearing bone (19) during exposure to microgravity. In an early review, it was shown that there is a loss of bone in both humans and animals after 1 wk to 237 d in microgravity (19). SLS-1 was the first opportunity to systematically measure parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium in serum samples from both male and female crew members during spaceflight. Arnaud and Cann (20) found a significant increase in serum-ionized calcium of ∼30% by d 2 of flight. Ionized serum calcium measured on d 8 was still elevated by ∼30%, measurements of PTH on the same days showed an ∼50% decrease in intact PTH (iPTH) during the mission. Even 16 d after landing, neither calcium nor iPTH values returned to normal (20).
PARÁGRAFO: The loss of bone on the Apollo 14–16 missions was almost 2%, even though the spaceflights lasted only 9 to 12 d (5). Although the Apollo missions were short in duration, the Apollo astronauts spent much of their time strapped down in a small capsule and were relatively immobile. The first crewed Skylab mission (Skylab 2) was 28 d, but because of extensive crew activity, no significant bone loss was noted. However, when Skylab missions increased to 2 and 3 mo, a significant loss of bone was seen (5). On Skylab 3 (59 d) only the scientist pilot had significant bone loss; on Skylab 4 (84 d), both the scientist pilot and the pilot had high levels of bone loss, suggesting that the length of exposure to weightlessness was a causal factor in loss of bone homeostasis (5). The commanders had little to no change in bone density, most possibly due to the increased exercise required in their duties. The underlying cause of the bone loss is thought to be due to the loss of mechanical stress in microgravity and duration of flight (8, 21–23).
PARÁGRAFO: Vico et al. (24) have reported up to a 24% loss of distal tibia trabecular bone in cosmonauts after 6 mo of spaceflight, as measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Six months after return, many of the cosmonauts did not show full recovery of bone mineral density (BMD). Lang et al. (25, 26) showed that over a 4- to 6-mo period of spaceflight, BMD was lost at rates of 0.9%/mo at the spine (P<0.001) and 1.4–1.5%/mo at the hip (P<0.001). They also measured the total, trabecular, and cortical volumetric BMD (vBMD) of the proximal femur. Spinal integral vBMD was lost at a rate of 0.9%/mo (P<0.001), and trabecular vBMD was lost at 0.7%/mo (P<0.05). In summary, their results show that ISS (Fig. 5) crew members, on average, experienced substantial and significant loss of both trabecular and cortical bone in the hip and somewhat smaller losses in the spine (25, 26). Later studies from ISS (25, 27–29) indicate that recovery of skeletal density after long-duration space missions may exceed 1 yr (27). It is of interest that bone loss occurred despite ∼2 h of daily exercise. This suggests that microgravity-induced bone loss may have an underlying cellular mechanism causing space osteoporosis. Studies of osteoblast-like cells showed a loss of cytoskeleton integrity in spaceflight as compared to ground (30) and 1-g flight controls (31). Others have found cytoskeleton changes in multiple cell types in simulated microgravity and spaceflight (32–36). Finally, osteoblastic cells were shown to have altered nuclear shape and reduced anabolic gene expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2), cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cpla2), osteocalcin (OC), c-myc, and fibroblast growth factor-2 (fgf-2) when compared to normal gravity (31). Further studies will determine whether gravity itself is required for normal bone growth.

PARÁGRAFO: On the Apollo missions, 15 of the 29 Apollo astronauts reported bacterial or viral infection during or within 1 wk of landing back on Earth (3). The relatively high incidence of infection on Apollo was thought to be correlated with the elevated cortisol levels and sympathetic activation detected in blood and urine samples from astronauts. These findings led early investigators to propose a systemic cause of infection (6, 37). Studies by Cogoli et al. (38, 39) demonstrated that lymphocytes have blunted activation during spaceflight, thus implicating gravity as a necessary factor in normal immune function.
PARÁGRAFO: Subsequent ground studies using gene arrays and quantative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that gravity was needed for normal T-cell activation (40). Using a random positioning machine to simulate microgravity, we surprisingly found that the induction of 91 genes depended on the presence of gravity. Gene induction is partially regulated by transcription factors on the promoter region at the 5′ end of the gene. Promoter region analysis found that the majority of genes down-regulated in microgravity were controlled by transcription factors NFκB, CREB, ELK, AP-1 and STAT—transcription factors that lie downstream of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling (40). New preliminary data from this laboratory (41) has shown that noncoding RNA is dysregulated in T cells activated in spaceflight on ISS as compared to 1-g onboard controls. This new level of regulation of immune cells in spaceflight offer new opportunities to study a new technology that can help identify unique pharmaceutical targets to treat immune disease.
PARÁGRAFO: Although much is known about immune status immediately following spaceflight, the understanding of immunity during spaceflight is limited. The few in-flight studies that have been performed indicate that spaceflight may be specifically associated with the reactivation of latent herpes viruses and impairment of cell mediated immunity (42–48). Observations of astronaut immune status after landing have shown numerous changes in immune cell function, including altered distribution of circulating lymphocytes, altered production of cytokines, decreased function of granulocytes, and decreased activation of T cells (8). Cases of latent viral reactivation, altered viral specific immunity, and expression of early/late gene Epstein-Barr viruses have been noted in astronauts after flight (42, 45–48). Future studies of viral reactivation in spaceflight may also shed new light on viral regulation here on Earth.
PARÁGRAFO: Studies with isolated human T cells in flight have demonstrated a loss of expression of early activation steps (38, 49–51). Recent studies of T cell activation of “astromouse” splenocytes after 16 d of spaceflight have demonstrated a reduction in expression of the same genes as seen in astronauts after landing. Analysis of flight and ground animals for gene expression of T cell activation markers interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2Rα, interferon-γ (IFNγ), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) were significantly decreased 2- to 10-fold in the activated flight splenocytes as compared to ground controls. Expression of cyclophilin and VEGF was unchanged. Protein synthesis of chemokines and cytokines IL-2, IL-2Rα, IFNγ, CCL-3 and TNF-α were also decreased in the flight cell supernatants when compared to ground controls. The observed down-regulation of induced T cell activation genes combined with changes of synthesis of their proteins show that animal immune cells require gravity and that the spaceflight-induced changes in T cell function continue hours after landing (52). More important, these data correspond with previous findings of human immune function in astronauts after return to Earth and support the conclusion of a physiological dependence of the immune system on gravity. These data suggest that at least one mammalian system in two species require gravity for full function. Potential adverse clinical effects that may be related to prolonged dysfunction of the immune system and spaceflight include hypersensitivity, autoimmunity, and frequency of infectious diseases (8).
PARÁGRAFO: There is mounting evidence that gravity is required for normal function of bone and immune cells. Since all of life developed in a gravity environment, it is not surprising that some biological systems may be dependent on gravity force. In mathematics, when a variable is removed from an equation, many times it can be solved. It is possible that the same is true for biological systems. Future studies of spaceflight-induced osteoporosis and immunosuppression may well yield new information and pharmaceutical targets to treat earthbound human diseases.
PARÁGRAFO: The flight of STS-135 ended the Shuttle era. However, there are plans to use the SpaceX Falcon rocket and its capsule, Dragon, to deliver supplies and experiments to ISS in the near future. Recently, NASA gave out $92 million to Boeing to help its development of the commercial crew development (CCDev2) capsule, $80 million to the Sahara Nevada Corporation to design a shuttle-like Dream Chaser craft, and $75 million to SpaceX to make improvements in the Dragon capsule for delivery of crewmen to ISS. Considering that the U.S. government is now paying Russia $63 million per astronaut for a single trip to and from ISS, these are modest technological investments to enable the United States to have transportation to ISS.
PARÁGRAFO: Will the United States fund space flight investigations on ISS to yield new medical discoveries and new technology? Will progress of science and technology advance during the next century as it did in the past 60 yr? It depends on funding; in 2003 ∼90% of NASA's science funding was “temporarily” cut after loss of spaceship Columbia; this essentially disabled all fields of space science at a time when ISS was becoming available for use. Reduced funding included cessation of student and graduate training, thereby severing the supply pipeline for the next generation of scientists. Unfortunately, that funding was never restored. Today, we are experiencing similar cuts in the National Institutes of Health budget that further limit medical research and training of new investigators.
PARÁGRAFO: Our future depends on today's visionaries—our writers must envision the future, our politicians must vote to fund that vision, and our schools must educate new engineers and scientists. Those engineers and scientists must work to develop new technologies and businessmen must engage the new technologies and renew our economy. Will science go to infinity and beyond by creating new jobs and securing our future prosperity? I certainly hope so.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosis-related genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.
PARÁGRAFO: Hyperoxia exposure promotes recruitment or local expansion of activated iNKT cells in the lungs. Over-activated iNKT leads to increased ferroptosis in AEC II, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α, AEC II dysfunction leads to the obstruction of alveolarization and occurrence of BPD. The figure was drawn online at Figuredraw (https://www.figdraw.com).

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell (ECs) function, and have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Three-dimensional (3D) culture of hepatocytes leads to improved and prolonged synthetic and metabolic functions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo, primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Altered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term space exploration. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR (n = 4). This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global microarray analysis showed significant (P < 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples. EGR3, FASLG, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP are biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms. Moreover, this study suggests that T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is self-limited by miR-21.—Hughes-Fulford, M., Chang, T. T., Martinez, E. M., Li, C.-F. Spaceflight alters expression of microRNA during T-cell activation.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The health risks of a dysregulated immune response during spaceflight are important to understand as plans emerge for humans to embark on long-term space travel to Mars. In this first-of-its-kind study, we used adoptive transfer of T-cell receptor transgenic OT-II CD4 T cells to track an in vivo antigen-specific immune response that was induced during the course of spaceflight. Experimental mice destined for spaceflight and mice that remained on the ground received transferred OT-II cells and cognate peptide stimulation with ovalbumin (OVA) 323-339 plus the inflammatory adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A. Control mice in both flight and ground cohorts received monophosphoryl lipid A alone without additional OVA stimulation. Numbers of OT-II cells in flight mice treated with OVA were significantly increased by 2-fold compared with ground mice treated with OVA, suggesting that tolerance induction was impaired by spaceflight. Production of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly increased in flight compared with ground mice, including a 5-fold increase in IFN-γ and a 10-fold increase in IL-17. This study is the first to show that immune tolerance may be impaired in spaceflight, leading to excessive inflammatory responses.—Chang, T. T., Spurlock, S. M, Candelario, T. L. T., Grenon, S. M., Hughes-Fulford, M. Spaceflight impairs antigen-specific tolerance induction in vivo and increases inflammatory cytokines.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: This article is based on a lecture I presented as the recipient of the 2009 Pritzker Distinguished Lecturer Award at the Biomedical Engineering Society annual meeting in October 2009. Here, I review more than thirty years of research from my laboratory, beginning with studies designed to test the theory that cells use tensegrity (tensional integrity) architecture to stabilize their shape and sense mechanical signals, which I believed to be critical for control of cell function and tissue development. Although I was trained as a cell biologist, I found that the tools I had at my disposal were insufficient to experimentally test these theories, and thus I ventured into engineering to find critical solutions. This path has been extremely fruitful as it has led to confirmation of the critical role that physical forces play in developmental control, as well as how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level through a process known as cellular mechanotransduction. Many of the predictions of the cellular tensegrity model relating to cell mechanical behaviors have been shown to be valid, and this vision of cell structure led to discovery of the central role that transmembrane adhesion receptors, such as integrins, and the cytoskeleton play in mechanosensing and mechanochemical conversion. In addition, these fundamental studies have led to significant unexpected technology fallout, including development of micromagnetic actuators for non-invasive control of cellular signaling, microfluidic systems as therapeutic extracorporeal devices for sepsis therapy, and new DNA-based nanobiotechnology approaches that permit construction of artificial tensegrities that mimic properties of living materials for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The International Space Station (ISS) is a complex built environment physically isolated from Earth. Assessing the interplay between the microbial community of the ISS and its crew is important for preventing biomedical and structural complications for long term human spaceflight missions. In this study, we describe one crewmember’s microbial profile from body swabs of mouth, nose, ear, skin and saliva that were collected at eight different time points pre-, during and post-flight. Additionally, environmental surface samples from eight different habitable locations in the ISS were collected from two flights. Environmental samples from one flight were collected by the crewmember and samples from the next flight were collected after the crewmember departed. The microbial composition in both environment and crewmember samples was measured using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and processed using the Livermore Metagenomics Analysis Toolkit. Ordination of sample to sample distances showed that of the eight crew body sites analyzed, skin, nostril, and ear samples are more similar in microbial composition to the ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples; and that the microbial composition of the crewmember’s skin samples are more closely related to the ISS surface samples collected by the crewmember on the same flight than ISS surface samples collected by other crewmembers on different flights. In these collections, species alpha diversity in saliva samples appears to decrease during flight and rebound after returning to Earth. This is the first study to compare the ISS microbiome to a crewmember’s microbiome via shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We observed that the microbiome of the surfaces inside the ISS resemble those of the crew’s skin. These data support future crew and ISS microbial surveillance efforts and the design of preventive measures to maintain crew habitat onboard spacecraft destined for long term space travel.

PARÁGRAFO: To explore how airborne microbial patterns change with height above the Earth’s surface, we flew NASA’s C-20A aircraft on two consecutive days in June 2018 along identical flight paths over the US Sierra Nevada mountain range at four different altitudes ranging from 10,000 ft to 40,000 ft. Bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing methods to characterize the composition and diversity of atmospheric samples compared to experimental controls. The relative abundance of taxa changed significantly at each altitude sampled, and the diversity profile shifted across the two sampling days, revealing a regional atmospheric microbiome that is dynamically changing. The most proportionally abundant microbial genera were Mycobacterium and Achromobacter at 10,000 ft; Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter at 20,000 ft; Delftia and Pseudoperonospora at 30,000 ft; and Alcaligenes and Penicillium at 40,000 ft. Culture-based detections also identified viable Bacillus zhangzhouensis, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus spp. in the upper troposphere. To estimate bioaerosol dispersal, we developed a human exposure likelihood model (7-day forecast) using general aerosol characteristics and measured meteorological conditions. By coupling metagenomics to a predictive atmospheric model, we aim to set the stage for field campaigns that monitor global bioaerosol emissions and impacts.

PARÁGRAFO: Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common condition in aging, diabetes, and in long duration spaceflights due to microgravity. This article investigates multi-modal gene disease and disease drug networks via link prediction algorithms to select drugs for repurposing to treat skeletal muscle atrophy. Key target genes that cause muscle atrophy in the left and right extensor digitorum longus muscle tissue, gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and the left and right soleus muscles are detected using graph theoretic network analysis, by mining the transcriptomic datasets collected from mice flown in spaceflight made available by GeneLab. We identified the top muscle atrophy gene regulators by the Pearson correlation and Bayesian Markov blanket method. The gene disease knowledge graph was constructed using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. We computed node embeddings, random walk measures from the networks. Graph convolutional networks, graph neural networks, random forest, and gradient boosting methods were trained using the embeddings, network features for predicting links and ranking top gene-disease associations for skeletal muscle atrophy. Drugs were selected and a disease drug knowledge graph was constructed. Link prediction methods were applied to the disease drug networks to identify top ranked drugs for therapeutic treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy. The graph convolution network performs best in link prediction based on receiver operating characteristic curves and prediction accuracies. The key genes involved in skeletal muscle atrophy are associated with metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs selected for repurposing using the graph convolution network method were nutrients, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory medications, and others related to insulin.

PARÁGRAFO: A detailed understanding of how spaceflight affects human health is essential for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of internal tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirms previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identifies a mitochondrial DNA-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board artificial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses.

PARÁGRAFO: A single exposure to hindlimb unloading leads to changes in body mass, body composition and bone, but the consequences of multiple exposures are not yet understood. Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one (1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading (HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched controls. In vivo µCT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses diminished in mice undergoing their 2nd or 3rd HLU cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from age-matched controls after the final RA period. In contrast, upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower than controls in all unloaded groups after the final RA period. These results suggest that tissues in the abdominal region are more resilient to multiple bouts of unloading and more amenable to recovery during reambulation than the peripheral musculoskeletal system.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Anthropologists frequently use the shaft bending strength index to infer the physical activity levels of humans living in the past from their lower limb bone remains. This index is typically calculated as the ratio of bone shaft second moments of area about orthogonal principal axes (i.e. Imax/Imin). Individuals with high Imax/Imin values are inferred to have been very active, whereas individuals with low values are inferred to have been more sedentary. However, there is little direct evidence that activity has a causal and predictable effect on the shaft bending strength index. Here, we report the results of two experiments that were designed to test the model within which anthropologists commonly interpret the shaft bending strength index. In the first experiment, mice were treated daily with treadmill exercise for 1 month to simulate a high-activity lifestyle. In the second experiment, in an attempt to simulate a low-activity lifestyle, functional weight-bearing was removed from the hindlimbs of mice for 1 month. Femoral mid-shaft structure was determined with μCT. We found that while exercise resulted in significant enhancement of Imax and Imin compared with controls, it failed to significantly increase the Imax/Imin index. Similarly, stunted bone growth caused by unloading resulted in significantly diminished Imax and Imin compared with controls, but low activity did not lead to significantly decreased Imax/Imin compared with normal activity. Together, these results suggest that caution is required when the bone shaft bending strength index is used to reconstruct the activity levels of past humans.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Force magnitudes have been suggested to drive the structural response of bone to exercise. As importantly, the degree to which any given bone can adapt to functional challenges may be enabled, or constrained, by regional variation in the capacity of marrow progenitors to differentiate into bone-forming cells. Here, we investigate the relationship between bone adaptation and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) responsivity in growing mice subject to exercise. First, using a force plate, we show that peak external forces generated by forelimbs during quadrupedal locomotion are significantly higher than hindlimb forces. Second, by subjecting mice to treadmill running and then measuring bone structure with μCT, we show that skeletal effects of exercise are site-specific but not defined by load magnitudes. Specifically, in the forelimb, where external forces generated by running were highest, exercise failed to augment diaphyseal structure in either the humerus or radius, nor did it affect humeral trabecular structure. In contrast, in the ulna, femur and tibia, exercise led to significant enhancements of diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area. Trabecular structure was also enhanced by running in the femur and tibia. Finally, using flow cytometry, we show that marrow-derived MSCs in the femur are more responsive to exercise-induced loads than humeral cells, such that running significantly lowered MSC populations only in the femur. Together, these data suggest that the ability of the progenitor population to differentiate toward osteoblastogenesis may correlate better with bone structural adaptation than peak external forces caused by exercise.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) responding to mechanical cues generated by physical activity is critical for skeletal development and remodeling. Here, we utilized low intensity vibrations (LIV) as a physiologically relevant mechanical signal and hypothesized that the confined cytoskeletal configuration imposed by 2D culture will enable human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSC) to respond more robustly when LIV is applied in-plane (horizontal-LIV) rather than out-of-plane (vertical-LIV). All LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and upregulated genes associated with cytoskeletal structure. The cellular response was more pronounced at higher frequencies (100 Hz vs 30 Hz) and when applied in the horizontal plane. Horizontal but not vertical LIV realigned the cell cytoskeleton, culminating in increased cell stiffness. Our results show that applying very small oscillatory motions within the primary cell attachment plane, rather than perpendicular to it, amplifies the cell’s response to LIV, ostensibly facilitating a more effective transfer of intracellular forces. Transcriptional and structural changes in particular with horizontal LIV, together with the strong frequency dependency of the signal, emphasize the importance of intracellular cytoskeletal configuration in sensing and responding to high-frequency mechanical signals at low intensities.

PARÁGRAFO: Little is known about interactions between muscle and bone during the removal and application of mechanical signals. Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Osteocyte apoptosis is essential to activate bone remodeling in response to fatigue microdamage and estrogen withdrawal, such that apoptosis inhibition in vivo prevents the onset of osteoclastic resorption. Osteocyte apoptosis has also been spatially linked to bone resorption owing to disuse, but whether apoptosis plays a similar controlling role is unclear. We, therefore, 1) evaluated the spatial and temporal effects of disuse from hindlimb unloading (HLU) on osteocyte apoptosis, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) expression, bone resorption, and loss in mouse femora, and 2) tested whether osteocyte apoptosis was required to activate osteoclastic activity in cortical and trabecular bone by treating animals subjected to HLU with the pan-caspase apoptosis inhibitor, QVD (quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[-2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methylketone). Immunohistochemistry was used to identify apoptotic and RANKL-producing osteocytes in femoral diaphysis and distal trabecular bone, and μCT was used to determine the extent of trabecular bone loss owing to HLU. In both cortical and trabecular bone, 5 days of HLU increased osteocyte apoptosis significantly (3- and 4-fold, respectively, p < 0.05 versus Ctrl). At day 14, the apoptotic osteocyte number in femoral cortices declined to near control levels but remained elevated in trabeculae (3-fold versus Ctrl, p < 0.05). The number of osteocytes producing RANKL in both bone compartments was also significantly increased at day 5 of HLU (>1.5-fold versus Ctrl, p <0.05) and further increased by day 14. Increases in osteocyte apoptosis and RANKL production preceded increases in bone resorption at both endocortical and trabecular surfaces. QVD completely inhibited not only the HLU-triggered increases in osteocyte apoptosis but also RANKL production and activation of bone resorption at both sites. Finally, μCT studies revealed that apoptosis inhibition completely prevented the trabecular bone loss caused by HLU. Together these data indicate that osteocyte apoptosis plays a central and controlling role in triggering osteocyte RANKL production and the activation of new resorption leading to bone loss in disuse.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In immunocompromised individuals, Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive fungal disease that is often difficult to treat. Exactly how immune mechanisms control A. fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A. fumigatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of A. fumigatus and highlight the ability of different A. fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Fungi are versatile organisms which thrive in hostile environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). Several isolates of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus have been found contaminating the ISS, an environment with increased exposure to UV radiation. Secondary metabolites (SMs) in spores, such as melanins, have been shown to protect spores from UV radiation in other fungi. To test the hypothesis that melanin and other known spore SMs provide UV protection to A. fumigatus isolates, we subjected SM spore mutants to UV-C radiation. We found that 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin mutants of two clinical A. fumigatus strains (Af293 and CEA17) but not an ISS-isolated strain (IF1SW-F4) were more sensitive to UV-C than their respective wild-type (WT) strains. Because DHN-melanin has been shown to shield A. fumigatus from the host immune system, we examined all DHN mutants for virulence in the zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis. Following recent studies highlighting the pathogenic variability of different A. fumigatus isolates, we found DHN-melanin to be a virulence factor in CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 but not Af293. Three additional spore metabolites were examined in Af293, where fumiquinazoline also showed UV-C-protective properties, but two other spore metabolites, monomethylsulochrin and fumigaclavine, provided no UV-C-protective properties. Virulence tests of these three SM spore mutants indicated a slight increase in virulence of the monomethylsulochrin deletion strain. Taken together, this work suggests differential roles of specific spore metabolites across Aspergillus isolates and by types of environmental stress.

PARÁGRAFO: A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms.

PARÁGRAFO: Main conclusion Blue-light positive phototropism in roots is masked by gravity and revealed in conditions of microgravity. In addition, the magnitude of red-light positive phototropic curvature is correlated to the magnitude of gravity.
PARÁGRAFO: Due to their sessile nature, plants utilize environmental cues to grow and respond to their surroundings. Two of these cues, light and gravity, play a substantial role in plant orientation and directed growth movements (tropisms). However, very little is currently known about the interaction between light- (phototropic) and gravity (gravitropic)-mediated growth responses. Utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System on board the International Space Station, we investigated the interaction between phototropic and gravitropic responses in three Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes, Landsberg wild type, as well as mutants of phytochrome A and phytochrome B. Onboard centrifuges were used to create a fractional gravity gradient ranging from reduced gravity up to 1g. A novel positive blue-light phototropic response of roots was observed during conditions of microgravity, and this response was attenuated at 0.1g. In addition, a red-light pretreatment of plants enhanced the magnitude of positive phototropic curvature of roots in response to blue illumination. In addition, a positive phototropic response of roots was observed when exposed to red light, and a decrease in response was gradual and correlated with the increase in gravity. The positive red-light phototropic curvature of hypocotyls when exposed to red light was also confirmed. Both red-light and blue-light phototropic responses were also shown to be affected by directional light intensity. To our knowledge, this is the first characterization of a positive blue-light phototropic response in Arabidopsis roots, as well as the first description of the relationship between these phototropic responses in fractional or reduced gravities.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Tropisms are growth-mediated plant movements that help plants to respond to changes in environmental stimuli. The availability of water and light, as well as the presence of a constant gravity vector, are all environmental stimuli that plants sense and respond to via directed growth movements (tropisms). The plant response to gravity (gravitropism) and the response to unidirectional light (phototropism) have long been shown to be interconnected growth phenomena. Here, we discuss the similarities in these two processes, as well as the known molecular mechanisms behind the tropistic responses. We also highlight research done in a microgravity environment in order to decouple two tropisms through experiments carried out in the absence of a significant unilateral gravity vector. In addition, alteration of gravity, especially the microgravity environment, and light irradiation produce important effects on meristematic cells, the undifferentiated, highly proliferating, totipotent cells which sustain plant development. Microgravity produces the disruption of meristematic competence, i.e., the decoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth, affecting the regulation of the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis. Light irradiation, especially red light, mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Phytohormones, particularly auxin, also are key mediators in these alterations. Upcoming experiments on the International Space Station will clarify some of the mechanisms and molecular players of the plant responses to these environmental signals involved in tropisms and the cell cycle.

PARÁGRAFO: Introduction: Traveling to nearby extraterrestrial objects having a reduced gravity level (partial gravity) compared to Earth’s gravity is becoming a realistic objective for space agencies. The use of plants as part of life support systems will require a better understanding of the interactions among plant growth responses including tropisms, under partial gravity conditions.
PARÁGRAFO: Materials and Methods: Here, we present results from our latest space experiments on the ISS, in which seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana were germinated, and seedlings grew for six days under different gravity levels, namely micro-g, several intermediate partial-g levels, and 1g, and were subjected to irradiation with blue light for the last 48 h. RNA was extracted from 20 samples for subsequent RNAseq analysis. Transcriptomic analysis was performed using the HISAT2-Stringtie-DESeq pipeline. Differentially expressed genes were further characterized for global responses using the GEDI tool, gene networks and for Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment.
PARÁGRAFO: Results: Differential gene expression analysis revealed only one differentially expressed gene (AT4G21560, VPS28-1 a vacuolar protein) across all gravity conditions using FDR correction (q < 0.05). However, the same 14 genes appeared differentially expressed when comparing either micro-g, low-g level (< 0.1g) or the Moon g-level with 1g control conditions. Apart from these 14-shared genes, the number of differentially expressed genes was similar in microgravity and the Moon g-level and increased in the intermediate g-level (< 0.1g), but it was then progressively reduced as the difference with the Earth gravity became smaller. The GO groups were differentially affected at each g-level: light and photosynthesis GO under microgravity, genes belonged to general stress, chemical and hormone responses under low-g, and a response related to cell wall and membrane structure and function under the Moon g-level.
PARÁGRAFO: Discussion: Transcriptional analyses of plants under blue light stimulation suggests that root blue-light phototropism may be enough to reduce the gravitational stress response caused by the lack of gravitropism in microgravity. Competition among tropisms induces an intense perturbation at the micro-g level, which shows an extensive stress response that is progressively attenuated. Our results show a major effect on cell wall/membrane remodeling (detected at the interval from the Moon to Mars gravity), which can be potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Life on Earth has evolved under the influence of gravity. This force has played an important role in shaping development and morphology from the molecular level to the whole organism. Although aquatic life experiences reduced gravity effects, land plants have evolved under a 1-g environment. Understanding gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. One method of eliminating gravity'’s influence is to enter into a free-fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object. This balance is often mistakenly referred to as microgravity, but is best described as weightlessness. In addition to actually compensating gravity, instruments such as clinostats, random-positioning machines (RPM), and magnetic levitation devices have been used to eliminate effects of constant gravity on plant growth and development. However, these platforms do not reduce gravity but constantly change its direction. Despite these fundamental differences, there are few studies that have investigated the comparability between these platforms and weightlessness. Here, we provide a review of the strengths and weaknesses of these analogs for the study of plant growth and development compared to spaceflight experiments. We also consider reduced or partial gravity effects via spaceflight and analog methods. While these analogs are useful, the fidelity of the results relative to spaceflight depends on biological parameters and environmental conditions that cannot be simulated in ground-based studies.

PARÁGRAFO: Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “water lentils” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Understanding how plants respond and adapt to extraterrestrial conditions is essential for space exploration initiatives. Deleterious effects of the space environment on plant development have been reported, such as the unbalance of cell growth and proliferation in the root meristem, or gene expression reprogramming. However, plants are capable of surviving and completing the seed-to-seed life cycle under microgravity. A key research challenge is to identify environmental cues, such as light, which could compensate the negative effects of microgravity. Understanding the crosstalk between light and gravity sensing in space was the major objective of the NASA-ESA Seedling Growth series of spaceflight experiments (2013–2018). Different g-levels were used, with special attention to micro-g, Mars-g, and Earth-g. In spaceflight seedlings illuminated for 4 days with a white light photoperiod and then photostimulated with red light for 2 days, transcriptomic studies showed, first, that red light partially reverted the gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, and that the combination of microgravity and photoactivation was not recognized by seedlings as stressful. Two mutant lines of the nucleolar protein nucleolin exhibited differential requirements in response to red light photoactivation. This observation opens the way to directed-mutagenesis strategies in crop design to be used in space colonization. Further transcriptomic studies at different g-levels showed elevated plastid and mitochondrial genome expression in microgravity, associated with disturbed nucleus–organelle communication, and the upregulation of genes encoding auxin and cytokinin hormonal pathways. At the Mars g-level, genes of hormone pathways related to stress response were activated, together with some transcription factors specifically related to acclimation, suggesting that seedlings grown in partial-g are able to acclimate by modulating genome expression in routes related to space-environment-associated stress.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Reduced mechanical loading during bedrest, spaceflight, and casting, causes rapid morphological changes in skeletal muscle: fiber atrophy and reduction of slow-twitch fibers. An emerging signaling event in response to unloading is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. We used EUK-134, a cell-permeable mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase, to test the role of redox signaling in nNOSμ translocation and muscle fiber atrophy as a result of short-term (54 h) hindlimb unloading. Fischer-344 rats were divided into ambulatory control, hindlimb-unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded + EUK-134 (HU-EUK) groups. EUK-134 mitigated the unloading-induced phenotype, including muscle fiber atrophy and muscle fiber-type shift from slow to fast. nNOSμ immunolocalization at the sarcolemma of the soleus was reduced with HU, while nNOSμ protein content in the cytosol increased with unloading. Translocation of nNOS from the sarcolemma to cytosol was virtually abolished by EUK-134. EUK-134 also mitigated dephosphorylation at Thr-32 of FoxO3a during HU. Hindlimb unloading elevated oxidative stress (4-hydroxynonenal) and increased sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits gp91phox (Nox2) and p47phox, effects normalized by EUK-134. Thus, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation from the sarcolemma and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as an early event during mechanical unloading. Thus, redox signaling may serve as a biological switch for nNOS to initiate morphological changes in skeletal muscle fibers.

PARÁGRAFO: Contractility of the heart is impaired with advancing age via mechanical remodeling, as myocytes are lost through apoptosis and collagenous fibers accumulate. Exercise training confers protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We recently reported that exercise training elevates Mn isoform of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) in the aging heart, concomitant with reduction in oxidative stress and fibrosis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of MnSOD would be causal in protection against fibrosis and apoptosis in the aging heart. Hearts were extracted from young (8 months) wild-type, young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene, old (28 months) wild-type, and old transgenic mice. Left ventricle MnSOD protein levels were elevated in young mice overexpressing the Sod2 (MnSOD) gene and old transgenic mice. MnSODTg mice exhibited lower oxidative stress (total hydroperoxides, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-isoprostane) in the old group. Age-related cardiac remodeling and fibrosis was mitigated in MnSOD Tg mice with reductions in extramyocyte space (−65%), collagen-I, and transforming growth factor-β. Pro-apoptotic markers Bax (−38%) and caspase-3 cleavage (−41%) were reduced and apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive nuclei, DNA laddering) was mitigated in MnSOD Tg hearts compared with old wild-type. We conclude that MnSOD elevation is indeed protective against oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the aging heart.

PARÁGRAFO: Apoptosis plays an important role in atrophy and sarcopenia in skeletal muscle. Recent evidence suggests that insufficient heat shock proteins (HSPs) may contribute to apoptosis and muscle wasting. In addition, long-term caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong wheel running exercise (WR) with CR provide significant protection against caspase-dependent apoptosis and sarcopenia. Caspase-independent mediators (endonuclease G: EndoG; apoptosis-inducing factor: AIF) of apoptosis are also linked to muscles wasting with disuse and aging. However, the efficacy of CR and WR with CR to attenuate caspase-independent apoptosis and preserve HSPs in aging skeletal muscle are unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CR and WR with CR would ameliorate age-induced elevation of EndoG and AIF while protecting HSP27 and HSP70 levels in the plantaris. Male Fischer-344 rats were divided into 4 groups at 11 weeks: ad libitum feeding until 6 mo. (YAL); fed ad libitum until 24 mo. old (OAL); 8%CR to 24 mo. (OCR); WR + 8%CR to 24 mo. (OExCR). Nuclear EndoG levels were significantly higher in OAL (+153%) than in YAL, while CR (−38%) and WR with CR (−46%) significantly attenuated age-induced increment in nuclear EndoG. HSP27 (−63%) protein content and phosphorylation at Ser82 (−49%) were significantly lower in OAL than in YAL, while HSP27 protein content was significantly higher in OCR (+136%) and OExCR (+155%) and p-HSP27 (+254%) was significantly higher in OExCR compared with OAL, respectively. In contrast, AIF and HSP70 were unaltered by CR or WR with CR in aging muscle. These data indicate that CR and WR with CR attenuate age-associated upregulation of EndoG translocation in the nucleus, potentially involved with HSP27 signaling.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment.

PARÁGRAFO: Mechanical unloading during microgravity causes skeletal muscle atrophy and impairs mitochondrial energetics. The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104 would rescue unloading-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with SRT2104 (SIRT). Oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer capacities, H2O2 production, and oxidative and antioxidant enzymes were quantified using high-resolution respirometry and colorimetry. In the gastrocnemius, (1) integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; (2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron transfer capacity (ECI+II) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to ECI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of LEAK to ECI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. In both muscles, H2O2 production and concentration was greatest in SIRT, as was gastrocnemius superoxide dismutase activity. In the soleus, H2O2 concentration was greater in HU compared to CON. These results indicate that SRT2104 preserves mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, suggesting its potential to support healthy muscle cells in microgravity by promoting necessary energy production in mitochondria.

PARÁGRAFO: Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.

PARÁGRAFO: Urine, humidity condensate, and other sources of non-potable water are processed onboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Water Recovery System (WRS) yielding potable water. While some means of microbial control are in place, including a phosphoric acid/hexavalent chromium urine pretreatment solution, many areas within the WRS are not available for routine microbial monitoring. Due to refurbishment needs, two flex lines from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) within the WRS were removed and returned to Earth. The water from within these lines, as well as flush water, was microbially evaluated. Culture and culture-independent analysis revealed the presence of Burkholderia, Paraburkholderia, and Leifsonia. Fungal culture also identified Fusarium and Lecythophora. Hybrid de novo genome analysis of the five distinct Burkholderia isolates identified them as B. contaminans, while the two Paraburkholderia isolates were identified as P. fungorum. Chromate-resistance gene clusters were identified through pangenomic analysis that differentiated these genomes from previously studied isolates recovered from the point-of-use potable water dispenser and/or current NCBI references, indicating that unique populations exist within distinct niches in the WRS. Beyond genomic analysis, fixed samples directly from the lines were imaged by environmental scanning electron microscopy, which detailed networks of fungal-bacterial biofilms. This is the first evidence of biofilm formation within flex lines from the UPA onboard the ISS. For all bacteria isolated, biofilm potential was further characterized, with the B. contaminans isolates demonstrating the most considerable biofilm formation. Moreover, the genomes of the B. contaminans revealed secondary metabolite gene clusters associated with quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. The potential production of these gene cluster metabolites was phenotypically evaluated through biofilm, bacterial-fungal interaction, and hemolytic assays. Collectively, these data identify the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche and novel area of biofilm growth within the WRS. Further investigation of these organisms and their resistance profiles will enable engineering controls directed toward biofilm prevention in future space station water systems.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: We present CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), an extension of CFDEM®Coupling to model biological flows, growth, and mass transfer in artificial microgravity devices. For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.

PARÁGRAFO: The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO2 increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.

PARÁGRAFO: Control over phenoxy radical-radical coupling reactions in vivo in vascular plants was enigmatic until our discovery of dirigent proteins (DPs, from the Latin dirigere, to guide or align). The first three-dimensional structure of a DP ((+)-pinoresinol-forming DP, 1.95 Å resolution, rhombohedral space group H32)) is reported herein. It has a tightly packed trimeric structure with an eight-stranded β-barrel topology for each DP monomer. Each putative substrate binding and orientation coupling site is located on the trimer surface but too far apart for intermolecular coupling between sites. It is proposed that each site enables stereoselective coupling (using either two coniferyl alcohol radicals or a radical and a monolignol). Interestingly, there are six differentially conserved residues in DPs affording either the (+)- or (−)-antipodes in the vicinity of the putative binding site and region known to control stereoselectivity. DPs are involved in lignan biosynthesis, whereas dirigent domains/sites have been implicated in lignin deposition.

PARÁGRAFO: Arogenate dehydratase (ADT) catalyzes the final step of phenylalanine (Phe) biosynthesis. Previous work showed that ADT-deficient Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) mutants had significantly reduced lignin contents, with stronger reductions in lines that had deficiencies in more ADT isoforms. Here, by analyzing Arabidopsis ADT mutants using our phenomics facility and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we describe the effects of the modulation of ADT on photosynthetic parameters and secondary metabolism. Our data indicate that a reduced carbon flux into Phe biosynthesis in ADT mutants impairs the consumption of photosynthetically produced ATP, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, the overaccumulation of transitory starch, and lower electron transport rates. The effect on electron transport rates is caused by an increase in proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane that down-regulates photosystem II activity by the high-energy quenching mechanism. Furthermore, quantitation of secondary metabolites in ADT mutants revealed reduced flavonoid, phenylpropanoid, lignan, and glucosinolate contents, including glucosinolates that are not derived from aromatic amino acids, and significantly increased contents of putative galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Additionally, we used real-time atmospheric monitoring mass spectrometry to compare respiration and carbon fixation rates between the wild type and adt3/4/5/6, our most extreme ADT knockout mutant, which revealed no significant difference in both night- and day-adapted plants. Overall, these data reveal the profound effects of altered ADT activity and Phe metabolism on secondary metabolites and photosynthesis with implications for plant improvement.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Multiple Arabidopsis arogenate dehydratase (ADT) knock-out (KO) mutants, with phenotypes having variable lignin levels (up to circa 70% reduction), were studied to investigate how differential reductions in ADTs perturb its overall plant systems biology. Integrated “omics” analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple ADT KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes–highly correlated to stem lignin levels–deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models in situ, with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering. Additionally, using KEGG defined functional categorization of proteomics and transcriptomics analyses, we detected significant changes to glucosinolate, α-linolenic acid, nitrogen, carotenoid, aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, and photosynthesis-related metabolic pathways in ADT KO mutants. Metabolomics results also revealed that putative carotenoid and galactolipid levels were generally increased in amount, whereas many glucosinolates and phenylpropanoids (including flavonoids and lignans) were decreased in the KO mutants.

PARÁGRAFO: Aims: Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we investigated whether low dose charged particle irradiation could elicit oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells and whether radiation-induced changes in redox metabolism would coincide with cognitive impairment. Results: Low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles caused an acute and persistent oxidative stress. Early after (<1 week) irradiation, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species were generally dose responsive, but were less dependent on dose weeks to months thereafter. Exposure to ion fluences resulting in less than one ion traversal per cell was sufficient to elicit radiation-induced oxidative stress. Whole body irradiation triggered a compensatory response in the rodent brain that led to a significant increase in antioxidant capacity 2 weeks following exposure, before returning to background levels at week 4. Low dose irradiation was also found to significantly impair novel object recognition in mice 2 and 12 weeks following irradiation. Innovation: Data provide evidence that acute exposure of neural stem cells and the CNS to very low doses and fluences of charged particles can elicit a persisting oxidative stress lasting weeks to months that is associated with impaired cognition. Conclusions: Exposure to low doses of charged particles causes a persistent oxidative stress and cognitive impairment over protracted times. Data suggest that astronauts subjected to space radiation may develop a heightened risk for mission critical performance decrements in space, along with a risk of developing long-term neurocognitive sequelae.

PARÁGRAFO: Beta cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by advances in stem cell biology, gene editing, and tissue engineering. While islet transplantation has demonstrated proof-of-concept success in restoring endogenous insulin production, its clinical impact remains limited by donor scarcity, immune rejection, and procedural complexities. The emergence of stem cell-derived beta-like cells represents a paradigm shift, with initial clinical trials showing promising insulin secretion in vivo. However, translating these breakthroughs into scalable, widely accessible treatments poses significant challenges. Drawing parallels to space exploration, this paper argues that while scientific feasibility has been demonstrated, true accessibility remains elusive. Without a strategic shift, beta cell therapy risks becoming an elite intervention, restricted by cost and infrastructure. Lessons from gene and cell therapies for rare diseases highlight the dangers of unsustainable pricing and limited market viability. To bridge the “last mile” a Quality by Design approach is proposed, emphasizing scalability, ease of use, and economic feasibility from the outset. By emphasizing practical implementation over academic achievements, corporate interests, market economics, or patent constraints, beta cell therapy can progress from proof-of-concept to a viable, widely accessible treatment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The transcriptomic datasets of the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana grown in the International Space Station provided by GeneLab have been mined to isolate the impact of spaceflight microgravity on gene expressions related to root growth. A set of computational tools is used to identify the hub genes that respond differently in spaceflight with controlled lighting compared to on the ground. These computational tools based on graph-theoretic approaches are used to infer gene regulatory networks from the transcriptomic datasets. The three main algorithms used for network analyses are Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Pearson correlation, and the Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) algorithm. Graph-based spectral analyses reveal distinct properties of the spaceflight microgravity networks for the Wassilewskija (WS), Columbia (Col)-0, and mutant phytochromeD (phyD) ecotypes. The set of hub genes that are significantly altered in spaceflight microgravity are mainly involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, response to auxin, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Network analysis highlights five important root growth-regulating hub genes that have the highest outdegree distribution in spaceflight microgravity networks. These concerned genes coding for proteins are identified from the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) corresponding to spaceflight total light environment. Furthermore, network analysis uncovers genes that encode nucleotide-diphospho-sugar interconversion enzymes that have higher transcriptional regulation in spaceflight microgravity and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Ionizing radiation present in extraterrestrial environment is an important factor that affects plants grown in spaceflight. Pearson correlation-based gene regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein–protein interactions in Arabidopsis reveals interaction profile similarities under low radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development. Eighteen radiation-induced genes and sixteen non-radiation-induced gene players have been identified from the ATR/ATM protein interaction complexes involved in heat, salt, water, osmotic stress responses, and plant organogenesis. Network analysis and logistic regression ranking detected AT3G27060, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, and AT3G21280 as key gene players involved in DNA repair processes. High atomic weight, high energy, and gamma photon radiation result in higher intensity of DNA damage response in the plant resulting in elevated values for several network measures such as spectral gap and girth. Nineteen flavonoid and carotenoid pigment activations involved in pigment biosynthesis processes are identified in low radiation dose total light spaceflight environment but are not found to have significant regulations under very high radiation dose environment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present significant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers. One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and experience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle Atlantis [Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135 (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice. However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may have negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of AEM-Flight mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic cells relative to AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve OB structure and function during future space missions.

PARÁGRAFO: The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/− 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4–19.3 mmHg vs 16.3–20.3 mmHg) (p < 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae.

PARÁGRAFO: Extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose (p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.

PARÁGRAFO: It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.

PARÁGRAFO: The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi-omics NASA GeneLab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and/or gamma irradiated for 21 days followed by retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month or 4 months post-exposure. We compared time-matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions, and 457 differentially expressed genes. Highest correlation in methylation difference was seen across different conditions at the same time point. Nucleotide metabolism biological processes were enriched in all groups with activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months. Genes and processes related to Notch and Wnt signaling showed alterations 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes showed significant changes in methylation and expression compared to unexposed controls, including genes involved in retinal function and inflammatory response. This multi-omics analysis interrogates the epigenomic and transcriptomic impacts of radiation and hindlimb unloading on the retina in isolation and in combination and highlights important molecular mechanisms at different post-exposure stages.

PARÁGRAFO: The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and retinal function impairment.

PARÁGRAFO: Under conditions of weightlessness human position sense appears to deteriorate. This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.

PARÁGRAFO: Spatial omics technologies enable a deeper understanding of cellular organizations and interactions within a tissue of interest. These assays can identify specific compartments or regions in a tissue with differential transcript or protein abundance, delineate their interactions, and complement other methods in defining cellular phenotypes. A variety of spatial methodologies are being developed and commercialized; however, these techniques differ in spatial resolution, multiplexing capability, scale/throughput, and coverage. Here, we review the current and prospective landscape of single cell to subcellular resolution spatial omics technologies and analysis tools to provide a comprehensive picture for both research and clinical applications.

PARÁGRAFO: During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB and TEF1), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T, isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium (Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.

PARÁGRAFO: The increasing accessibility of commercial and private space travel necessitates a profound understanding of its impact on human health. The NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) provides transparent and FAIR access to biological studies, notably the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which amassed extensive data from civilian astronauts. This dataset encompasses omics and clinical assays, facilitating comprehensive research on space-induced biological responses. These data allow for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments, bridging the gap between human and model organism studies. Crucially, community-driven data standards established by NASA’s OSDR Analysis Working Groups empower artificial intelligence and machine learning to glean invaluable insights, guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. This article presents a concise guide to access and analyze I4 data in OSDR, including programmatic access through GLOpenAPI. This pioneering effort establishes a precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs within space agencies, propelling research in the burgeoning field of commercial space travel’s impact on human physiology.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Human spaceflight has historically been managed by government agencies, such as in the NASA Twins Study1, but new commercial spaceflight opportunities have opened spaceflight to a broader population. In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term spaceflight2, but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts3, which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Telomeres are repetitive nucleoprotein complexes at chromosomal termini essential for maintaining genome stability. Telomeric RNA, or TERRA, is a previously presumed long noncoding RNA of heterogeneous lengths that contributes to end-capping structure and function, and facilitates telomeric recombination in tumors that maintain telomere length via the telomerase-independent Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. Here, we investigated TERRA in the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) across astronauts, high-altitude climbers, healthy donors, and cellular models. Similar to astronauts in the space radiation environment and climbers of Mt. Everest, in vitro radiation exposure prompted increased transcription of TERRA, while simulated microgravity did not. Data suggest a specific TERRA DDR to telomeric double-strand breaks (DSBs), and provide direct demonstration of hybridized TERRA at telomere-specific DSB sites, indicative of protective TERRA:telomeric DNA hybrid formation. Targeted telomeric DSBs also resulted in accumulation of TERRA foci in G2-phase, supportive of TERRA’s role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. Results have important implications for scenarios involving persistent telomeric DNA damage, such as those associated with chronic oxidative stress (e.g., aging, systemic inflammation, environmental and occupational radiation exposures), which can trigger transient ALT in normal human cells, as well as for targeting TERRA as a therapeutic strategy against ALT-positive tumors.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight can change metabolic, immunological, and biological homeostasis and cause skin rashes and irritation, yet the molecular basis remains unclear. To investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on the skin, we conducted skin biopsies on the Inspiration4 crew members before (L-44) and after (R + 1) flight. Leveraging multi-omics assays including GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics/metatranscriptomics, we assessed spatial gene expressions and associated microbial and immune changes across 95 skin regions in four compartments: outer epidermis, inner epidermis, outer dermis, and vasculature. Post-flight samples showed significant up-regulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling across all skin regions. These spaceflight-associated changes mapped to specific cellular responses, including altered interferon responses, DNA damage, epithelial barrier disruptions, T-cell migration, and hindered regeneration were located primarily in outer tissue compartments. We also linked epithelial disruption to microbial shifts in skin swab and immune cell activity to PBMC single-cell data from the same crew and timepoints. Our findings present the inaugural collection and examination of astronaut skin, offering insights for future space missions and response countermeasures.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Maintenance of astronaut health during spaceflight will require monitoring and potentially modulating their microbiomes. However, documenting microbial shifts during spaceflight has been difficult due to mission constraints that lead to limited sampling and profiling. Here we executed a six-month longitudinal study to quantify the high-resolution human microbiome response to three days in orbit for four individuals. Using paired metagenomics and metatranscriptomics alongside single-nuclei immune cell profiling, we characterized time-dependent, multikingdom microbiome changes across 750 samples and 10 body sites before, during and after spaceflight at eight timepoints. We found that most alterations were transient across body sites; for example, viruses increased in skin sites mostly during flight. However, longer-term shifts were observed in the oral microbiome, including increased plaque-associated bacteria (for example, Fusobacteriota), which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Further, microbial genes associated with phage activity, toxin–antitoxin systems and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. In total, this study reveals in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts experienced by astronauts during short-term spaceflight and the associated changes to the living environment, which can help guide future missions, spacecraft design and space habitat planning.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: It is now widely recognised that the environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis, with a particular emphasis on those involved in globin chain production. Haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics, as it has been extensively explored at multiple -omic levels, spanning DNA, RNA, and protein analyses, in both experimental and clinical contexts. In this study, we examined the developmental expression of haemoglobin over time and space using a unique suite of multi-omic datasets available on NASA GeneLab, from the NASA Twins Study, the JAXA CFE study, and the Inspiration4 mission. Our findings reveal significant variations in globin gene expression corresponding to the distinct spatiotemporal characteristics of the collected samples. This study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment and provides valuable insights into the broader implications of space omics research.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight induces an immune response in astronauts. To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Microgravity is associated with immunological dysfunction, though the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight induces molecular, cellular and physiological shifts in astronauts and poses myriad biomedical challenges to the human body, which are becoming increasingly relevant as more humans venture into space1–6. Yet current frameworks for aerospace medicine are nascent and lag far behind advancements in precision medicine on Earth, underscoring the need for rapid development of space medicine databases, tools and protocols. Here we present the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), an integrated data and sample repository for clinical, cellular and multi-omic research profiles from a diverse range of missions, including the NASA Twins Study7, JAXA CFE study8,9, SpaceX Inspiration4 crew10–12, Axiom and Polaris. The SOMA resource represents a more than tenfold increase in publicly available human space omics data, with matched samples available from the Cornell Aerospace Medicine Biobank. The Atlas includes extensive molecular and physiological profiles encompassing genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiome datasets, which reveal some consistent features across missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation and gene expression changes, as well as mission-specific molecular responses and links to orthologous, tissue-specific mouse datasets. Leveraging the datasets, tools and resources in SOMA can help to accelerate precision aerospace medicine, bringing needed health monitoring, risk mitigation and countermeasure data for upcoming lunar, Mars and exploration-class missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: As spaceflight becomes more common with commercial crews, blood-based measures of crew health can guide both astronaut biomedicine and countermeasures. By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development.

PARÁGRAFO: Future multi-year crewed planetary missions will motivate advances in aerospace nutrition and telehealth. On Earth, the Human Cell Atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. Here, we propose that a parallel Human Cell Space Atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. As humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high-resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight healthcare. Alongside the scientific potential, we consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the human space omics discipline, and how philosophical frameworks may benefit from international perspectives.

PARÁGRAFO: Missions into Deep Space are planned this decade. Yet the health consequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts’ increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.

PARÁGRAFO: Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.

PARÁGRAFO: Common and rare alleles are now being annotated across millions of human genomes, and omics technologies are increasingly being used to develop health and treatment recommendations. However, these alleles have not yet been systematically characterized relative to aerospace medicine. Here, we review published alleles naturally found in human cohorts that have a likely protective effect, which is linked to decreased cancer risk and improved bone, muscular, and cardiovascular health. Although some technical and ethical challenges remain, research into these protective mechanisms could translate into improved nutrition, exercise, and health recommendations for crew members during deep space missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the “space production” of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions—0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6–12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5–8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv ‘Outredgeous,’ plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24–72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 – 4.86 log10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts’ diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Polyamines, including cadaverine, are organic cations that affect numerous biological processes including transcription, translation, cell signalling, and ion channel activity. They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors that contribute to this response. Here it is shown that Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have varying root length responses to exogenous cadaverine: Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas Landsberg erecta (Ler) was one of the most sensitive. Recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines, and a microarray were used to show that variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1) is at least partially responsible for this difference. OCT1 expression was higher in Cvi than in Ler, and oct1 mutants were more sensitive to cadaverine than wild-type plants. In oct1 mutants transformed with an ectopic copy of OCT1 originating from either Cvi or Ler, the expression level of the transgene, not its accession, correlated with the cadaverine response. These results suggest that decreased OCT1 expression confers cadaverine sensitivity in some accessions.

PARÁGRAFO: We evaluated the effect of AsiMax 50®, a commercial formulation of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), on the structure of both micro + nano phytoplankton (>2 μm; species composition and abundance) and cytometric populations (photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP, 0.2–2 μm), which included prokaryotic phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria (PC-Pcy), phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (PE-Pcy) and eukaryotic phototrophs (PEuk); and bacterioplankton (HB), heterotrophic bacteria), using a microcosms-based approach and a single 7-day exposure. Assays were performed on two different microbial assemblages sampled from freshwater bodies of two contrasting turbidity status: clear (chlorophyll a = 7.6 μgL-1, turbidity = 1 NTU) and organic turbid systems (chlorophyll a = 25.0 μgL-1, turbidity = 9 NTU). For each system, the herbicide was applied to 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks, at seven concentration levels of the active ingredient (a.i.): 0 (control = no addition), 0.02, 0.2, 2, 20, 200 and 2,000 mg a.i.L−1. The impact of AsiMax 50® seemed to be greater in the turbid system. In this system, total abundance of living (live) micro + nano phytoplankton showed a significant increase at lower concentrations and data were fitted to a humped-shaped curve. For both clear and organic turbid systems, micro + nano phytoplankton decreased in species richness and abundance at higher herbicide concentrations. These results suggest that 2,4-D may mimic hormonal function. Some species, such as Ochromonas sp. and Chlamydomonas sp., showed different responses to herbicide exposure between water systems. In the turbid system, the increase in abundance of the PPP fraction observed at 7-d exposure was probably due to either an increase in PE-Pcy (thus suggesting the existence of auxin pathways) or a reduction in competitive pressure by micro + nano plankton. Our results provide some evidence of the importance of using community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies to predict changes in freshwater ecosystems exposed to a 2,4-D-based formulation. However, caution must be taken when extrapolating these effects to real scenarios, as assays were based on a laboratory microcosm experiment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism.

PARÁGRAFO: Cadaverine, a polyamine, has been linked to modification of root growth architecture and response to environmental stresses in plants. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of root growth by cadaverine are largely unexplored. Here we conducted a forward genetic screen and isolated a mutation, cadaverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3), which resulted in increased root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine, but not other polyamines. This mutation affects the BIO3‐BIO1 biotin biosynthesis gene. Exogenous supply of biotin and a pathway intermediate downstream of BIO1, 7,8‐diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed this cadaverine sensitivity phenotype. An in vitro enzyme assay showed cadaverine inhibits the BIO3‐BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine‐treated seedlings displayed reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 of the acetyl‐coenzyme A carboxylase complex involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, resulting in decreased accumulation of triacylglycerides. Taken together, these results revealed an unexpected role of cadaverine in the regulation of biotin biosynthesis, which leads to modulation of primary root growth of plants.
PARÁGRAFO: Keywords: polyamines, cadaverine, biotin, root architecture, Arabidopsis thaliana
PARÁGRAFO: Cadaverine is a polyamine produced by plants and microbes, which has been shown to accumulate in plants under stress conditions and to inhibit primary root growth. Here, we show that cadaverine affects Arabidopsis root growth primarily by inhibiting the biotin biosynthesis pathway, thereby affecting primary metabolism and the lipid profile.
PARÁGRAFO: Cadaverine (1,5‐diaminopentane) is a polyamine associated with environmental perception and modulation of biological processes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In plants, alterations in cadaverine levels induce changes in root architecture (Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991; Liu et al., 2014; Niemi et al., 2002; Strohm et al., 2015), fresh weight (Cassán, 2009; Tomar et al., 2013), and stress response (Aziz et al., 1998; Cassán, 2009; Kuznetsov et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2000; Shevyakova et al., 2001; Sziderics et al., 2010) with implications in crop yield and environmental stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016).
PARÁGRAFO: Cadaverine is produced by decarboxylation of lysine in plastids (Bunsupa et al., 2012), a process that has been shown to be upregulated by environmental stresses, including heat, drought, and salt stress, in ice plant (Kuznetsov et al., 2007; Shevyakova et al., 2001), pepper (Sziderics et al., 2010), and maize (Simon‐Sarkadi et al., 2014). On the other hand, free cadaverine levels are below the limit of detection in Arabidopsis thaliana (Bunsupa et al., 2012; Shimizu et al., 2019). However, all plants can accumulate cadaverine directly from their environment, in the form of molecules secreted by microbes from the phyllosphere, rhizosphere or endosphere, or diffusing from decomposing matter (Cassán, 2009). Importantly, both endogenous cadaverine and exogenously applied cadaverine can modulate plant growth and environment‐related stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016). A. thaliana seedlings exposed to exogenous cadaverine display altered root‐growth behavior, clearly indicating a role for this compound in root‐growth regulation (Strohm et al., 2015).
PARÁGRAFO: Similar to other polyamines, cadaverine catabolism produces hydrogen peroxide and other derived compounds, which serve as transducers in a variety of physiological, developmental, and environmental stress responses in animals, plants, and microbes. In Leguminosae, cadaverine is a precursor for quinolizidine alkaloids, which act to deter insects (Bunsupa et al., 2012). Much of the polyamine content within plant cells has been shown to be in the conjugated form (Torrigiani et al., 1987). Cadaverine can conjugate to lignin precursors, although other acceptors of conjugation are possible (Negrel et al., 1992).
PARÁGRAFO: Despite these important roles of cadaverine in a broad aspect of plant development and physiology, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that modulate plant responses to cadaverine. To date, three cadaverine‐response genes have been identified in A. thaliana: OCT1, PAO4, and SPMS (Liu et al., 2014; Strohm et al., 2015). OCT1 encodes an organic cation transporter previously implicated in carnitine transport (Lelandais‐Brière et al., 2007; Strohm et al., 2015). PAO4, on the other hand, encodes a polyamine oxidase that functions in the back‐conversion of spermine into spermidine, and spermidine into putrescine (Liu et al., 2014). SPMS encodes a spermine synthase.
PARÁGRAFO: To understand this process better, we carried out a forward genetic screen in A. thaliana, seeking mutations that affect root‐growth responses to exogenous cadaverine. This screen revealed biotin as a possible target for the cadaverine‐induced pathway. In addition, the named vitamin B7 or H, biotin is an essential cofactor that functions in carboxylation reactions associated with de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and amino acid homeostasis (Alban et al., 2000).
PARÁGRAFO: In both plants and fungi, biotin synthesis starts with the conversion of pimeloyl‐coenzyme A (pimeloyl‐CoA) to 7‐keto‐8‐aminoperlargonic acid (KAPA), which is catalyzed by the cytosol‐ and peroxisome‐localized KAPA synthase enzyme (encoded by the BIO4 gene in Arabidopsis) (Pinon, 2005; Tanabe et al., 2011). Subsequent reactions occur in the mitochondria, and produce 7,8‐diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA), dethiobiotin (DTB), and finally biotin. These reactions are catalyzed by the DAPA synthase (BIO1), DTB synthase (BIO3), and biotin synthase (BIO2) enzymes, respectively (Cobessi et al., 2012; Muralla et al., 2007; Picciocchi et al., 2001; Shellhammer and Meinke, 1990). In plants and fungi, BIO1 and BIO3 form a bifunctional, homodimeric enzyme that is encoded by a single gene (Arabidopsis BIO3‐BIO1, At5G57590) (Muralla et al., 2007).
PARÁGRAFO: In Arabidopsis, five carboxylases have been shown to use biotin as a cofactor: acetyl‐CoA carboxylase (ACCase; which catalyzes the first step in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis) (Sasaki et al., 1993; Yanai et al., 1995), 3‐methylcrotonyl‐CoA carboxylase (MCCase; which contributes to leucine catabolism) (Alban et al., 1993; Song et al., 1994), propionyl‐CoA carboxylase (an enzyme that functions at the intersection between fatty acid, amino acid, and sugar metabolism pathways) (Wurtele and Nikolau, 1990), geranoyl‐CoA carboxylase (Guan et al., 1999), and pyruvate carboxylase (a key contributor to gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis) (Wurtele and Nikolau, 1990; reviewed in Nikolau et al., 2003). A role for biotin beyond its function as a cofactor in carboxylases has also been suggested (Che, 2003), as has its potential contribution to the regulation of expression of defense‐related genes (Li et al., 2012). Furthermore, an uncharacterized nuclear‐localized biotinylated protein has also been identified as potential regulator of target gene expression (Li et al., 2012).
PARÁGRAFO: In this work, we show that cadaverine modulates primary root growth, mainly, by altering the biotin metabolic pathway in A. thaliana. Cadaverine‐induced inhibition of root growth can be rescued with supplementation of biotin and biotin‐pathway intermediates downstream of BIO1. Furthermore, we observed that decreased biotinylation of ACCase subunit BCCP1, as a result of cadaverine treatment, leads to a reduction of fatty acid synthesis. This study will contribute toward understanding how biotin limitation affects plant growth, and the role of cadaverine as a natural biotin inhibitor.
PARÁGRAFO: To identify molecular candidates in cadaverine response in plants, we carried out a forward genetic screen using a population of ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)‐mutagenized A. thaliana plants in the Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) background. We screened M2 seedlings for altered root growth on media containing 200 µm cadaverine. One of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive mutants identified in this screen, named cadaverine hypersensitive 3 (cdh3), showed a significant inhibition of primary root growth on cadaverine‐containing media relative to wild type (Figure 1a and Figure S1). This mutant is the main subject of investigation in this manuscript.
PARÁGRAFO: cdh3 is hypersensitive to cadaverine (Cad).
PARÁGRAFO: (a) 10‐day‐old Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) and cdh3 seedlings germinated on vertical plates containing 200 μm cadaverine or control media.
PARÁGRAFO: (b) Dose–response of seedlings germinated on cadaverine media. Root growth between day 6 and 10 is quantified. Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): Col 2.29 ± 0.045 cm; cdh3 1.94 ± 0.096 cm. Whiskers represent minimum to maximum values.
PARÁGRAFO: (c) Seedlings were germinated on 200 μm cadaverine or control media and treated with propidium iodide to stain the cell walls. Stained roots were then analyzed using confocal microscopy. Five seedlings were analyzed per treatment group. White stars indicate the quiescent center. White arrowheads indicate the end of the root meristem.
PARÁGRAFO: (d) Length of the meristem was quantified by identifying cells in the cortex whose length is greater than the width, and measuring the distance from the distal wall this cell to the distal wall of the quiescent center. Bars represent standard error, with dots showing data points.
PARÁGRAFO: (e) Numbers of cells in the meristems were counted from the quiescent center to the end of the meristem along the cortex. Bars represent standard error, with dots showing data points.
PARÁGRAFO: (f) Root tip growth following transfer of 5‐day‐old seedlings from control to split agar plates containing either control media, or media supplemented with 200 μm cadaverine. Root tip growth was recorded using a high‐resolution camera for 96 h and quantified using ImageJ. Data points represent the three seedlings per treatment. Bars indicate standard error. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 analyzed by a mixed‐effects model with an F‐test for the interaction between time and treatment with Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons.
PARÁGRAFO: (g) cdh3 and wild‐type root growths were measured from day 6 to 10 on control or media supplemented with the indicated concentrations of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Root growths were standardized to growth on control media for each genotype. Whiskers show minimum to maximum values. ANOVA with Tukey's HSD correction was used to determine significance.
PARÁGRAFO: To characterize cdh3 further, we first plated wild‐type and cdh3 mutant seeds on media containing cadaverine, ranging from 2 µm to 2 mm, and quantified primary root growth under these conditions. The results demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect of cadaverine at concentrations as low as 2 µm for cdh3, whereas a significant effect of cadaverine on wild‐type root growth was observed only at concentrations of 20 µm and higher (Figure 1b). At 20 µm cdh3 primary roots were 58.4% shorter than wild type. On control media lacking cadaverine, cdh3 seedlings showed only a minor decrease in primary root growth compared with wild type (Figure 1a).
PARÁGRAFO: In previous work involving wild‐type Ler seedlings, Strohm et al. showed that exogenous cadaverine inhibits primary root growth mostly by affecting cell elongation (Strohm et al., 2015). They also demonstrated the existence of substantial natural variation between Arabidopsis accessions in their primary root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine (Strohm et al., 2015). Therefore, we tested the effects of exogenous cadaverine on wild‐type Col‐0, analyzing cell elongation and apical root meristem size. Eight‐day‐old seedlings were grown on 200 µm cadaverine or control media, and roots were treated with propidium iodide, a cell‐wall stain (Strohm et al., 2015), to determine cell sizes and zone boundaries in the root tip. The decrease in primary root growth was found to be mostly associated with alterations in cell size within the elongation zone (Figure S2), whereas the number of cells in the root apical meristem was not substantially affected in the wild type (Figure 1c–e). However, cdh3 showed a significantly smaller root meristem upon cadaverine treatment, while cdh3 grown on control media showed an equal number of cells compared with wild type. In addition to decreased cell division and cell expansion in cdh3, propidium iodide permeated a number of cells within the elongation zone, suggesting cell death (Figure 1c).
PARÁGRAFO: We next wanted to determine the time at which cell elongation is modified following cadaverine treatment by measuring changes in tip growth over time. Five‐day‐old seedlings were transferred on to split agar plates containing control or 200 µm cadaverine media and imaged for 4 days using a high‐resolution camera. Wild‐type roots began to show a significant decrease in tip growth after 96 h of cadaverine treatment. cdh3, on the other hand, showed a decrease in root tip growth already 40 h after onset of cadaverine treatment (Figure 1f). Therefore, the cdh3 mutation substantially increases the speed of root‐tip response to exogenous cadaverine.
PARÁGRAFO: Because arginine‐derived polyamines, such as putrescine and putrescine‐derived spermidine and spermine, were previously shown to also affect primary root growth in young Arabidopsis seedlings, we tested ability of cdh3 to respond to these polyamines as well (Liu et al., 2014; Strohm et al., 2015). The results demonstrated that cdh3 and wild type show similar root‐growth response to putrescine and spermine, with cdh3 showing only a mild resistance to 500 µm spermidine (Figure 1g). Hence, the cdh3 mutation increases root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine, and it has little to no effect on root responses to putrescine and putrescine‐derived polyamines.
PARÁGRAFO: Taken together, our data indicate that cdh3 alters a mechanism involved in the control of primary root growth in response to cadaverine, a process that targets the regulation of anisotropic cell expansion occurring in the main elongation zone as well as the meristem.
PARÁGRAFO: To evaluate the genetic makeup of cdh3, we backcrossed it to Col‐0, and self‐pollinated the corresponding F1. Segregating F2 progeny were investigated for root‐growth sensitivity to cadaverine. Results showed 22.6% seedlings (12 of 53) exhibiting hypersensitive cadaverine response, consistent with a single, recessive mutation (chi‐squared value of 0.1179; P ˜ 0.3). To clone CDH3, we generated a pool of 162 cadaverine‐hypersensitive cdh3 F2 seedlings from this segregating population, extracted DNA from this pool, and subjected it to whole genome next‐generation sequencing. The candidate mutation was mapped to a 4.6 Mb region of chromosome 5, using the approach described in Schneeberger et al. (2009). Within this region, a non‐synonymous mutation was found within the BIO3‐BIO1 gene (At5G57590), which encodes a bifunctional enzyme involved in biotin synthesis (Cobessi et al., 2012). This mutation resulted in an A662T amino acid change within the BIO1 catalytic pocket of the protein (Figure 2a,b), which functions as an aminotransferase that catalyzes the conversion of KAPA into DAPA within the pathway. The A662 amino acid is located in close proximity to the pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)‐cofactor binding site, potentially affecting enzymatic activity (Figure 2c).
PARÁGRAFO: cdh3 contains a mutation in BIO3‐BIO1.
PARÁGRAFO: (a) Next‐generation sequencing revealed a peak on chromosome 5 with a high proportion of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with the reference sequence. Table shows mutations within the 4.6‐Mb peak region containing non‐synonymous SNPs in protein‐coding genes.
PARÁGRAFO: (b) Gene structure for BIO3‐BIO1 is shown indicating the position of the SNP in cdh3.
PARÁGRAFO: (c) 3D structure of the catalytic site of BIO1, deduced from the crystal structure resolved in Cobessi et al. (2012). This structure, imaged with pymol software, shows the substrate (7‐keto‐8‐aminoperlargonic acid [KAPA], in pink) and the cofactor (pyridoxal phosphate [PLP], in blue) bound to L666. Position of Ala662, which is converted into a threonine in cdh3, is indicated in yellow.
PARÁGRAFO: (d) Quantification of standardized root growth on control and 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media from day 6 to 10 of wild‐type, cdh3, or cdh3 transformation–rescue lines (cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1]) with the wild type BIO3‐BIO1 transgene under the control of its native promoter. BIO3‐BIO1 rescue lines are at the T3 generation. Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) 2.54 cm ± 0.045; cdh3 2.05 cm ± 0.073 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 1 2.73 cm ± 0.075; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 2 2.37 cm ± 0.104 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 3 2.36 cm ± 0.063 cm; cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1 4 2.53 cm ± 0.073 cm. Whiskers represent minimum to maximum.
PARÁGRAFO: (e) Quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction analysis of BIO3‐BIO1 in 8‐day‐old wild‐type, cdh3, and cdh3[BIO3‐BIO1pro:BIO3‐BIO1] seedlings grown on control media. Bars represent standard error, with dots showing biological replicates. (d,e) Significant differences between groups detected using ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction (P < 0.05), are indicated with distinct letters.
PARÁGRAFO: To confirm the association of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype of cdh3 with the A662T mutation in BIO3‐BIO1, we transformed a wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1 transgene under the control of its native promoter into cdh3. Four independent, homozygous transgenic lines (cdh3 [BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1]) were recovered and screened on cadaverine‐containing media. Results shown in Figure 2d demonstrated rescue of the cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype of cdh3 by the wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1 transgene in all four independent lines. Furthermore, the transgene also rescued the decreased root‐growth phenotype displayed by cdh3 on control media, suggesting the corresponding A662T mutation in BIO3‐BIO1 was also responsible for cdh3 root‐growth restriction on control media (Figure 1a).
PARÁGRAFO: While performing these transformation–rescue experiments, we also noted that three of the four transformation–rescue lines (lines 1, 3, and 4) displayed increased root‐growth resistance to cadaverine, a phenotype that is opposite to the hypersensitive response displayed by cdh3. To determine if the transformation–rescue lines displayed increased transgene expression level, BIO3‐BIO1 expression was quantified using reverse transcription (RT)‐quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on 8‐day‐old seedlings grown on control media. While no significant expression alterations were found between cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings, transformation–rescue lines displayed 4.5–14.8‐fold increases in BIO3‐BIO1 expression relative to wild type (Figure 2e). The level of root‐growth insensitivity to cadaverine correlated with increased expression in resistant transformation–rescue lines (R 2 = 0.68). Taken together, these results suggest dosage of BIO3‐BIO1 affects the root‐growth response to cadaverine.
PARÁGRAFO: Initial studies with the embryo‐lethal bio1‐1 mutant showed that knockout of biotin synthesis in plants can be rescued by application of exogenous biotin (Schneider et al., 1989). To determine if cdh3’s hypersensitive root‐growth response to cadaverine is the result of decreased biotin, we supplemented 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media with biotin at concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 nm (Schneider et al., 1989). The cadaverine‐hypersensitive phenotype displayed by cdh3 roots was rescued in a dose‐dependent manner to near wild‐type root growth by addition of biotin (Figure 3a). In addition, the inhibitory effect of cadaverine on wild‐type root growth was also suppressed by addition of 80 nm biotin to the medium (Figure 3a). These data are compatible with cadaverine targeting the biotin pathway or modulating biotin availability or function. Alternatively, cadaverine and biotin could function through parallel pathways to modify primary root growth.
PARÁGRAFO: Biotin suppresses wild‐type primary root growth response to cadaverine (Cad) and rescues the hypersensitive root growth response of cdh3.
PARÁGRAFO: (a) Standardized root growth of wild‐type and cdh3 mutant seedlings on 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media in the presence of 0–100 nm biotin. ***P < 0.001 using Student’s t‐test. Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) 3.505 ± 0.0925 cm; cdh3 2.605 ± 0.326 cm. Whiskers show minimum to maximum values.
PARÁGRAFO: (b) Wild‐type and cdh3 mutant root growth from day 6 to 10 on media with or without 200 μm cadaverine, in the presence of 1 μm biotin, 7‐keto‐8‐aminoperlargonic acid (KAPA) or 7,8‐diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA). A simplified biotin synthesis pathway is shown on the right of this graph. Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): Col‐0 3.452 ± 0.582 cm; cdh3 2.985 ± 0.115 cm. Minimum to maximum values are represented by whiskers.

Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): WS 1.663 ± 0.0322 cm; oct1‐1 1.569 ± 0.066 cm; Col‐0 1.523 ± 0.174 cm; oct1‐2 1.44 ± 0.033 cm. Whiskers show minimum to maximum values.
PARÁGRAFO: (d) Standardized root growth of wild‐type Col‐0 and pao4‐1 and pao4‐2 mutant seedlings on media with or without 200 μm cadaverine, in the presence or absence of 1 μm biotin. Root growth on control media (average ± standard error): Col 1.938 ± 0.457 cm; pao4‐1 2.230 ± 0.046 cm; pao4‐2 2.361 ± 0.043 cm. (b–d) Significance was determined using ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction. Different letters indicate statistically different groups (P < 0.05). Whiskers show minimum to maximum values.
PARÁGRAFO: To identify a step in the biotin synthesis pathway that may be potentially affected by cadaverine, we tested intermediate compounds of the biotin biosynthesis pathway for their abilities to suppress root‐growth response to cadaverine. Figure 3b shows that addition of 1 μm DAPA, the product of BIO1 activity, resulted in complete suppression of cadaverine's effects on root growth, whereas addition of 1 μm KAPA, the BIO1 substrate, did not. These results suggest that BIO2, BIO3, and BIO4 functions are not impaired by cadaverine. Rather, BIO1 enzymatic activity, channeling of DAPA to the BIO3 active site, or KAPA’s availability or transport, is/are inhibited by cadaverine.
PARÁGRAFO: As root‐growth response to cadaverine can be alleviated by biotin supplementation in both cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings, we tested if we could identify cadaverine‐hypersensitive lines that cannot be rescued by biotin, thereby identifying downstream regulators in the cadaverine‐response pathway. ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 mutant, oct1‐1, and POLYAMINE OXIDASE 4 mutant, pao4‐1, have been shown to be hypersensitive to cadaverine (Liu et al., 2014; Strohm et al., 2015). oct1 and pao4 mutants were tested for chemical rescue on biotin‐ and cadaverine‐containing media. As shown in Figure 3c,d oct1 and pao4 mutant roots no longer displayed cadaverine hypersensitivity in the presence of biotin. Hence, biotin appears to function downstream of, or parallel to, OCT1 and PAO4 in the cadaverine‐response pathway.
PARÁGRAFO: As the results of the chemical rescue experiment suggest that cadaverine may target DAPA synthase, we expressed wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1 recombinant protein in vitro to test whether its enzymatic activity was fully functional upon cadaverine treatment. Previous in vitro studies by Cobessi et al., have shown that the product of the BIO1 reaction, DAPA, is channeled from the BIO1 active site to the BIO3 active site, and thus not released into the solution. Therefore, we chose to detect the product of BIO3, DTB using a FRET‐based competition assay, in which DTB will displace the lower affinity 4′‐hydroxyazobenzene‐2‐carboxylic acid quencher from fluorescently tagged avidin (Batchelor et al., 2007). We set up in vitro reactions in the presence or absence of cadaverine to determine whether cadaverine alters the enzyme activity. The result shown in Figure 4a indicates less formation of DTB in reactions containing cadaverine compared with control. The data suggest that cadaverine affects the flow of molecules through the biotin synthesis pathway at the level of DAPA or DTB synthesis, leading to decreased biotin synthesis and altered root growth. Attempts to express the cdh3 mutant protein in vitro were unsucessful, suggesting the A662T mutation may affect BIO3‐BIO1 protein stability.
PARÁGRAFO: Cadaverine (Cad) inhibits BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic activity.
PARÁGRAFO: (a) BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity‐purified. In vitro enzymatic assays contained 50 μm cadaverine and 20 μm KAPA. A negative control assay was carried out with 0 μm KAPA with or without 50 μm cadaverine, to control for background fluorescence (see Experimental procedures). Reactions were run for 8 min before heat‐treating to stop the reaction. *P < 0.05 based on Student’s t‐test. Bars represent standard error, with individual data points showing biological replicates. DTB, dethiobiotin.
PARÁGRAFO: (b) BIO3‐BIO1 expression is unaltered by cadaverine treatment. BIO3‐BIO1 expression was quantified using quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction on cDNA prepared from RNA extracted from 8‐day‐old seedlings germinated on 200 μm cadaverine or control media, or transferred to cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h. Expression is standardized to PP2A reference gene. No statistically significant differences were observed using ANOVA. Bars represent standard error with values of individual biological replicates shown as symbols according to genotype and treatment indicated in the key.
PARÁGRAFO: (c) BIO3‐BIO1 protein expression was quantified using a western‐blot approach. 8‐day‐old seedlings were grown on cadaverine‐containing media for 72 h. Proteins were extracted from whole seedlings and run on a sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Following electro‐transfer, the PVDF membrane was exposed to a BIO3‐BIO1‐specific antibody to determine protein level. An antibody directed against a proteasomal protein, RPT4A was also used as a loading control. Blot shown here is representative of three biological replicates that gave similar results. In each blot, band intensities were quantified and standardized to RPT4A for each lane. Results of these quantifications are plotted in the graph shown to the right of the blot, with the value of each biological replicate shown as a symbol indicated in the key. Bars indicate standard error. **P < 0.01 using Student’s t‐test against Columbia‐0 (Col‐0) on control condition.
PARÁGRAFO: To determine if cadaverine also affects the regulation of BIO3‐BIO1 expression, we next quantified the levels of BIO3‐BIO1 transcripts in control and cadaverine‐treated wild‐type and cdh3 seedlings. RNA was extracted from whole seedlings germinated on cadaverine‐containing media, or treated with cadaverine for 24, 48, or 72 h, along with controls grown on cadaverine‐free medium. No significant differences were identified between cadaverine‐treated and control samples, or between cdh3 and wild‐type seedlings (Figure 4b). In addition, cadaverine did not influence the expression of other biotin synthesis genes, BIO4 (At5G04620) and BIO2 (At2G43360) (Figure S3). This result contrasts with an earlier report that showed increased BIO2 expression upon biotin depletion (Patton et al., 1996). Together, these data suggest that cadaverine‐induced inhibition of biotin synthesis under our conditions is not sufficiently severe to result in increased BIO2 expression.
PARÁGRAFO: To investigate a potential effect of cadaverine on BIO3‐BIO1 protein abundance, wild‐type, cdh3, and cdh3 [BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] rescue line #2 were germinated and grown on either control or cadaverine‐containing media for 8 days. Proteins were extracted from dissected root and shoot tissues, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subjected to Western blot analysis, probing with a BIO3‐BIO1‐specific antibody (Cobessi et al., 2012). The cdh3 [BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] rescue line expressed increased amounts of BIO3‐BIO1 protein relative to wild type, irrespective of cadaverine treatment (Figure 4c), consistent with its increased BIO3‐BIO1 transcripts (Figure 2e). Minimal differences in relative BIO3‐BIO1 protein abundance were observed between cadaverine‐treated and control samples for all genotypes and tissues tested (Figure 4c), suggesting that cadaverine has limited impacts on overall expression of the BIO3‐BIO1 protein in Arabidopsis.
PARÁGRAFO: Considering that cadaverine inhibits biotin synthesis, we hypothesized that treating Arabidopsis seedlings with cadaverine should result in decreased biotinylation of target proteins in plant tissues. Previous studies have shown that probing Western blot membranes with a streptavidin probe allows the detection of a minimum of three biotinylated plant proteins, including MCCA, involved in amino acid metabolism, and the biotin carboxyl carrier protein 1 and 2 subunits (BCCP1 and BCCP2) of chloroplastic, heterodimeric ACCase, involved in fatty acid metabolism (Aubert et al., 1996; Che, 2003; Li et al., 2012). BCCP2 is primarily expressed in flowers and developing seeds, but scarcely detectable in seedling tissues (Thelen et al., 2001). We used a similar Western blot analysis to determine whether cadaverine treatment is sufficient to induce differences in MCAA and/or BCCP proteins biotinylation in dissected root and/or shoot tissues.
PARÁGRAFO: Wild‐type, cdh3, and cdh3 [BIO3‐BIO1pro::BIO3‐BIO1] #2 rescue seedlings were germinated and grown on control or cadaverine‐containing media for 8 days. Roots and shoots were then dissected. Proteins extracted from these samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using a streptavidin probe. The amounts of biotinylated MCCA protein showed little change upon cadaverine treatment in the root (Figure 5a,c) or shoot (Figure 5b,d). On the other hand, a decrease in biotinylated BCCP1 protein was observed in both roots (Figure 5a,e) and shoots (Figure 5b,f), with a larger magnitude of decrease occurring in the roots.
PARÁGRAFO: Levels of biotinylated proteins are altered following cadaverine (Cad) treatment.
PARÁGRAFO: (a,b) Seed were germinated on control or cadaverine‐containing media. Following 8 days of treatment, roots (a) and shoots (b) were dissected and protein was extracted. 150 µg of protein were loaded on to sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed. After electro‐transfer on to a PVDF membrane, biotinylated proteins were detected with Licor IRDye CW800‐labeled streptavidin or anti‐biotin carboxyl carrier protein (anti‐BCCP) 1 and 3‐methylcrotonyl‐CoA carboxylase (MCCA) antibodies. In all cases, anti‐RPT4A antibodies were used to control for loading differences between samples. Blots shown in (a,b) are representative of three biological replicates showing similar results. Quantifications of band intensities from these blots are summarized in (c–f) for all three biological replicates.
PARÁGRAFO: (c–f) Protein amount and biotinylation were quantified based on band intensity, standardized to the RPT4A signals, and then standardized again to Columbia‐0 (Col‐0). Expression results shown in the graphs represent three biological replicates, with a circle or square indicating the value of each control or cadaverine replicate, respectively. Bars indicate standard error. *Student's t‐test P < 0.05. **P < 0.01, compared with Col‐0 control treatment. (c) MCCA total protein and MCCA biotinylation in roots. (d) MCCA total protein and biotinylation in shoots. (e) BCCP1 total protein and BCCP1 biotinylation in roots. (f) BCCP1 total protein and BCCP1 biotinylation in shoots.
PARÁGRAFO: Cadaverine‐induced changes in biotinylated protein abundance could be due to decreased levels of target protein biotinylation, and/or relate to changes in abundance of the corresponding proteins. To investigate these possibilities, we used MCCA‐ and BCCP1‐specific antibodies to analyze the abundance of these proteins in control and cadaverine‐treated seedlings. Results shown in Figure 5c demonstrated increased MCCA levels in the root upon cadaverine treatment only in cdh3, while no significant changes were observed in the shoot (Figure 5d). BCCP1 protein abundance in cadaverine‐treated samples relative to controls, showed no significant changes in the root or shoot (Figure 5e,f).
PARÁGRAFO: qRT‐PCR analysis of MCCA and BCCP1 expression showed no significant transcriptional alteration in cdh3 and Col‐0 upon cadaverine treatment, whether applied since germination, or for 24, 48, or 72 h (Figure S4). Taken together, our data are consistent with cadaverine treatment leading to decreased biotin synthesis, thereby resulting in decreased biotinylation in BCCP1 protein in both shoots and roots. They are also consistent with decreased biotinylation levels of MCCA protein in cdh3 mutant roots, as increased MCCA apoprotein abundance is not accompanied by increased levels of biotinylated MCCA (Figure 5c).
PARÁGRAFO: In summary, cadaverine treatment significantly affects the amount of biotinylated BCCP1 protein in both shoots and roots.
PARÁGRAFO: ACCase requires biotinylation of the BCCP1 subunit to generate malonyl‐CoA from acetyl‐CoA at the first step of fatty acid biosynthesis. The cadaverine‐induced reduction in biotinylated BCCP1 protein in plant tissues is expected to decrease fatty acid production. To test this hypothesis, we determined the impact of cadaverine treatment on the lipid profile of Arabidopsis seedlings. Wild‐type Col‐0 seeds were germinated and grown on control media for 5 days, then transferred to either control media or media containing 200 µm cadaverine, and allowed to grow for 72 more hours, a time previously determined to be sufficient to allow primary root growth inhibition by cadaverine (Figure 1). At that time, lipids were extracted from these samples, and subjected to lipidomics analyses by tandem mass spectrometry (Shiva et al., 2013). Total polar lipids as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids, were analyzed with five biological replicates.
PARÁGRAFO: The results showed that total TAG decreased in abundance upon cadaverine treatment, with six of 31 TAG species showing significant decreases (Figure 6), all of which were TAGs having 18:3 acyls. On the other hand, TAGs containing short‐chain fatty acids, 16:0 and 16:1, had little changes with the treatment (Figure 6). The reduced TAG synthesis along with the higher percentage of short‐chain fatty acid compositions in TAGs were also previously observed in Arabidopsis plants with limited biotin availability (Pommerrenig et al., 2012). Therefore, these results are consistent with the negative effect of cadaverine on biotin availability and TAG production.
PARÁGRAFO: Triacylglycerol content following 72 h of cadaverine (Cad) treatment.
PARÁGRAFO: Columbia‐0 seedlings were germinated on control media and transferred to either control or 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media after 5 days. 72 h post‐treatment, whole seedlings were harvested and used for lipid extraction and analysis using tandem mass spectrometry. The average of five biological replicates are shown containing approximately 200 seedlings per replicate, with dots representing each replicate. Bars indicate standard error. Student’s t‐test was done to determine significance between cadaverine treatment and control. *P < 0.05. **P < 0.01.
PARÁGRAFO: We observed similar levels of total polar lipid species between cadaverine‐treated and control seedlings, with slight decreases observed in total PA and phosphatidylinositol (PI), and an increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Table S1). Although total DAG levels were not altered by cadaverine treatment, specific DAGs changed in abundance in response to cadaverine, including increases in DAG 16:0/16:1, DAG 18:0/16:2 and DAG 18:3/dnOPDA, and decreases in DAG 18:3/18:3 content (Table S1). In addition, we have also seen modification of phospholipids, albeit below the significance threshold, with PI and PA decreasing with cadaverine treatment.
PARÁGRAFO: We have shown that cadaverine functions to inhibit primary root growth by modulating biotin synthesis through inhibition of the BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme. Cadaverine response can be chemically rescued with biotin, DAPA, but not KAPA. While KAPA could potentially be excluded from transport into seedlings, the results of our in vitro reaction show cadaverine to inhibit BIO3‐BIO1 activity. Furthermore, cadaverine did not alter the expression of BIO3‐BIO1 at the protein level in wild‐type or cdh3, and overexpression of BIO3‐BIO1 from our cdh3 rescue line resulted in increased BIO3‐BIO1 protein and resistance to cadaverine, in agreement with an effect on BIO3‐BIO1 enzymatic function.
PARÁGRAFO: Analysis of the BIO3‐BIO1 mutant, cdh3, reported here shows biotin deficiency results in decreased primary root growth, which is similar to the phenotype observed in the hypomorphic mutation in BIO4 (Li et al., 2012). Furthermore, analysis of cdh3 root growth on cadaverine‐containing media also shows evidence of cell death in the elongation zone upon staining with propidium iodide (Figure 1c). Evidence of cell death was also reported in shoots of a hypomorphic mutant of BIO4 (Li et al., 2012), indicating that decreases in biotin cause cell death in both roots and shoots. The localization of cell death to the elongation zone of cadaverine‐treated cdh3 may reflect an increased requirement for biotin in tissues that undergo rapid cell growth and expansion. Alternatively, deficiencies in fatty acid synthesis have been shown to result in an accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the mitochondria, along with cell death (Wu et al., 2015). The similar phenotypes observed in cadaverine‐treated cdh3 mutant seedlings (this study) and biotin‐deficient mutants (Li et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2015) thus suggest that a deficiency in biotin synthesis may underlie the developmental impact of cadaverine.
PARÁGRAFO: Inhibition of biotin synthesis has long been a target for herbicides and antibiotics. While numerous compounds have been identified to inhibit biotin biosynthesis, to date only one natural product, amiclenomycin, had been identified to inhibit DAPA synthase in bacteria, through formation of a covalent adduct with PLP (Sandmark et al., 2002). Our results indicate cadaverine is a natural DAPA synthase inhibitor in Arabidopsis. Cadaverine may function to inhibit BIO3‐BIO1 through formation of a Schiff base with PLP, as observed with amiclenomycin, or through direct interaction with the binding site. BIO3‐BIO1 inhibition by cadaverine cannot be mimicked by treatments with putrescine and/or putrescine‐derived polyamines. The different inhibitory activities displayed by distinct polyamines may be determined by charge distribution of the amine groups or subcellular compartmentalization. Given the proximity of A662 to PLP, the hypersensitive response of cdh3 mutant to cadaverine could be explained by an altered conformation of the mutant protein resulting in decreased reaction efficiency. However, multiple attempts at producing recombinant cdh3 mutant enzyme failed, preventing us from directly testing this hypothesis. Future work will be aimed at characterizing cadaverine’s inhibitory effect on DAPA synthase activity in plants.
PARÁGRAFO: As we have shown exogenous biotin rescues the cadaverine response phenotype, the effect of cadaverine treatment on primary root growth is in part associated with induced alterations in lipid composition, including decreased TAG content, and/or signaling phospholipids. Analysis of SUC5, required for biotin transport into the developing embryo from the maternal plant, shows the suc5 and bio1 or bio2 double mutants rescued with exogenous biotin have an increased proportion of short chain fatty acids (16:0 and 16:1), in accordance with our observation of cadaverine treatment (Figure 6; Table S1) (Pommerrenig et al., 2012). The decrease in PI and PA could be due to increased activity through the phosphoinositide pathway to generate DAG to compensate for decreases in TAG. Alternatively, cadaverine may function to affect the components of the phosphoinositide pathway, independently from its effect on biotin, contributing to the root growth phenotype we see in response to cadaverine.
PARÁGRAFO: Biotin is also involved in amino acid homeostasis, gluconeogenesis, and other aspects of central metabolism. MCCase has previously been shown to accumulate in response to biotin depletion or starvation to allow for recycling of amino acids (Aubert et al., 1996; Che, 2003; Ding et al., 2012). The increase of MCCA apoprotein in cdh3 (Figure 5a,c) is compatible with a mechanism that allows modulation of target MCCA protein abundance by biotin availability, in agreement with previous studies (Che, 2003; Li et al., 2012). The absence of such changes in cadaverine‐treated wild‐type plants may simply reflect a lower level of biotin limitation in wild‐type roots.
PARÁGRAFO: While root growth inhibition of cdh3 was not observed with putrescine‐derived polyamines (Figure 1g), the pao4 phenotype and subsequent rescue by biotin (Figure 3d) suggests a connection between cadaverine and the putrescine‐derived polyamines. Polyamine oxidases, such as PAO4, oxidize polyamines spermidine and spermine, thereby contributing to putrescine‐derived polyamines homeostasis (Kamada‐Nobusada et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2014). pao4 mutants show increased spermine content, decreased spermidine and hydrogen peroxide, and changes in primary metabolism (Sequera‐Mutiozabal et al., 2016). Altered primary metabolism associated with the pao4 mutation may reflect an indirect role for the putrescine‐derived polyamines or their catabolic products in biotin synthesis or the downstream effects of biotin.
PARÁGRAFO: The putrescine‐derived polyamines are essential components for growth and development; for example, thermospermine is required for vasculature development in Arabidopsis (Kakehi et al., 2008) and spermidine is required for eukaryotic translation (Park et al., 1982). Studies on the functions of putrescine‐derived polyamines have been hampered by the embryo lethality associated with spermidine depletion (Imai et al., 2004). Therefore, it is possible that putrescine‐derived polyamines provide other essential roles that have yet to be uncovered.
PARÁGRAFO: OCT1 has been characterized as a carnitine transporter and was proposed to transport cations, such as polyamines (Lelandais‐Brière et al., 2007; Strohm et al., 2015). In mammals the carnitine cycle allows acyl transport into the mitochondria for beta‐oxidation. An analogous mechanism has been proposed in plants after identification of a carnitine acyl carrier‐like protein with homology to mammalian carnitine acyl carrier, but the role of carnitine in plants has yet to be further elucidated (Lawand et al., 2002). oct1 mutants could be sensitive to cadaverine because of altered polyamines homeostasis and/or localization. Alternatively, cadaverine‐induced lipid deficiency could be exacerbated by altered acyl transport capabilities in the oct1 mutants.
PARÁGRAFO: In some plants, cadaverine abundance has been found to increase in response to environmental stress, a process that is believed to contribute to stress mitigation. Furthermore, microbes from the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, or endosphere have also been shown to provide plants with cadaverine, as does decomposing matter in proximity of a root system (Cassán, 2009). Both endogenous and exogenously applied cadaverine can modulate plant growth and environment‐related stress resistance (reviewed in Jancewicz et al., 2016). We present here that cadaverine inhibits biotin biosynthesis and primary metabolism in Arabidopsis through direct inhibition of DAPA synthase, thereby reducing the accumulation of TAGs. If the physiological responses to cadaverine are adaptive, the presence of cadaverine, either through association with microbes (in most plants including A. thaliana) or through stress‐induced synthesis, where observed, may serve to divert a plant’s resources from growth to defense responses. Future investigations addressing the conservation of cadaverine‐response pathways in plants, and the development of methods aimed at better controlling the effects of cadaverine on biotin synthesis, its impact on primary metabolism within the biomass, and on root‐system architecture, should yield important new insights, facilitating the development of new crop varieties with improved productivity, enhanced energy content of the biomass, and increased adaptability to the stresses associated with climate change or growth on marginal lands.
PARÁGRAFO: Seedlings were grown on plates containing 1.5% agar, 0.5× Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) media pH 5.7 with 1.5% sucrose unless otherwise noted. After 48 h of stratification, plates were moved to a 22°C growth chamber under long day conditions, 60 μmol m–2 sec–1 white light (cool‐white fluorescent bulbs) and the wave assay was carried out as described in Rutherford and Masson (1996). Day lengths were 16 h. After 6 days of growth, the position of the root tip was marked and seedlings were grown for 4 more days. After 10 days, plates were scanned using a document scanner and the growth from Day 6 to 10 was measured using the Neuron J plugin of ImageJ. Root growth was standardized to the control of each mutant line.
PARÁGRAFO: To determine if the response was specific to cadaverine, mutant lines were screened on media supplemented with putrescine (5, 10, and 15 mm), spermidine (300, 500, and 700 μm), and spermine (200, 300, and 400 μm), and root growth measurements were carried out as described above.
PARÁGRAFO: Zeiss confocal LSM780 microscope was used to characterize cell size and morphology of cadaverine‐treated roots. Eight‐day‐old seedlings were germinated on control media or 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media. Seedlings were grown as described above. After 8 days in the growth chamber, seedlings were stained with 1.0 mg ml–1 propidium iodide for approximately 2 sec and then rinsed with water. Roots were imaged using a 561‐nm laser, 20× objective. Images were analyzed using ImageJ. Meristem was defined from the quiescent center to the first elongated cell in the cortex. The number of cells in the meristem was counted from the quiescent center along files of cortical cells to the first elongated cell (Perilli et al., 2010). The cell length in the mature zone was quantified by measuring cells in the epidermis using ImageJ.
PARÁGRAFO: Seedlings were germinated on control media (as above) and grown vertically to reduce waving. Three days after germination, seedlings were transferred to control or 200 μm cadaverine‐containing media and grown under 60 μmol m–2 sec–1 of continuous light. A high‐resolution raspberry pi camera was used to image seedlings every 8 h. Imaging began within 10 min after transfer. ImageJ was used to measure tip growth every 8 h. Statistical difference in root tip growth between cadaverine and control treatment was tested using a mixed effects model with an F‐test for the interaction between time and treatment, corrected with Tukey’s adjustment for multiple comparisons in SAS Studio Version 3.8 (Gueorguieva and Krystal, 2004).
PARÁGRAFO: To generate an EMS population, approximately 0.19 g of Col‐0 seeds (M0) were treated with 50 ml of 0.2% EMS for 15 h, then rinsed with water eight times (Weigel and Glazebrook, 2002). On the last wash, seeds were soaked in water for an hour. Seeds were then resuspended in 0.1% agar and pipetted on to soil. After EMS application M0 seeds are referred to as M1. M1 plants were self‐pollinated and M2 seeds were collected in individual pools for each plant. In total, 1064 M2 lines were screened on plates containing LS media supplemented with 200 μm cadaverine. Seedlings showing a hypersensitive response, a decrease in root growth compared with the wild type on cadaverine media, were self‐pollinated and the M3 lines were rescreened on 200 μm cadaverine and control media. Root growth of these M3 lines was quantified as described above. Student’s t‐test was done against Col‐0 to determine if the mutant line was hypersensitive to cadaverine (Figure S1).
PARÁGRAFO: A mapping population of cdh3 was generated by backcrossing cdh3 to wild‐type Col‐0. The segregating F2 population was screened on 50 μm cadaverine plates as described above, omitting sucrose. In total, 162 cadaverine hypersensitive seedlings were pooled and frozen in liquid nitrogen, then homogenized with a 4.5‐mm steel bead using Mixmill. DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Next‐generation sequencing was done using Illumina HiSeq 2000 (UW‐Biotech Facility) with 100 bp, paired‐end reads. dnastar software (version 12.3) was used for alignment and variant identification. Reads with a Q value <30 were removed from analysis. Variants present in multiple EMS mutant lines and Col‐0 were subtracted from the cdh3 variant list. The location of the mutation was identified by looking at the percentage single nucleotide polymorphism along the position in the genome (Zuryn et al., 2010).
PARÁGRAFO: Seedlings were germinated on LS media with or without 200 μm cadaverine and 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 nm biotin. Biotin was prepared as described in Schneider et al. (1989). Seedling root growth was quantified as described above. Student’s t‐test was done to determine significance against Col‐0 using P < 0.05 as a cut off.
PARÁGRAFO: Primers containing adapters for Asc1 and Pac1 restriction sites were used to amplify Col‐0 wild‐type BIO3‐BIO1 genomic DNA (At5G57590), from 1233 bp upstream from the transcriptional start site to 382 bp 3′ of the stop codon, yielding a 5706‐bp product. The PCR reaction was restriction‐digested with Asc1 and Pac1 and ligated into pMDC99 (Curtis, 2003). The ligated product was transformed into Escherichia coli DUO competent cells (Lucigen, Middleton, WI, USA) and selected on 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin. Transformation rescue was done on the cdh3 mutant using the floral dip method as described (Clough and Bent, 1998) using Agrobacteria strain GV3101. T1 seeds were screened on 50 μg ml–1 hygromycin to identify positive transformants.
PARÁGRAFO: Protein expression of pET‐mBIO3‐BIO1 was carried out as described previously (Cobessi et al., 2012). The plasmid was introduced into Rosetta‐2 E. coli competent cells (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) and cultured overnight at 37°C, 200 r.p.m. in 10 ml LB medium containing 50 μg ml–1 kanamycin. After overnight growth the culture was transferred into 500 ml LB with appropriate antibiotic and supplemented with 10 μm pyridoxine and 15 μm thiamin (Cobessi et al., 2012). The culture was incubated at 37°C until the OD600 reached 0.3. At this point, 0.4 mm isopropylthio‐β‐d‐galactoside was added, and the culture was grown for 16 h at 18°C, shaking at 200 rpm. Cells were then harvested by centrifuged at 4°C for 20 min at 4000  g . Pellet was resuspend in lysis buffer with additional 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 500 μm PLP. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 10 000  g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatant was collected and subjected to QIAexpress Ni‐NTA column purification (Qiagen). Eluted protein was desalted using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units, Ultra‐15 MWCO 50 kDa (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA, USA). Protein was stored and diluted in 100 mm HEPPS pH 8.6.
PARÁGRAFO: The assay was modified from the method developed by Cobessi et al. (2012). Reaction buffer contained the following: 100 mm HEPPS pH 8.6, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm AdoMet, 10 mm NaHCO3, and 0.3 mm ATP. Each reaction included various concentrations of racemic hydrochloride‐KAPA (synthesized according to the procedure described by Nudelman et al. (2004) as substrate (0 or 20 µm), along with 0 or 50 µm cadaverine dihydrochloride. The BIO3‐BIO1 enzyme at a final concentration of 6.9 µm was added to start the reactions. Reactions were run at 25°C for 8 min. At the end of each reaction, the enzyme was inactivated by addition of 20% acetic acid. Inactivated enzyme was removed from the reaction using a 10‐kDa column (Pall NanoSep). DTB was detected using FluoReporter Biotin Quantitation Assay Kit (F30751; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). Twenty‐five microliters of reaction product was mixed with 25 µl 2× Biotective Green Reagent and incubated for 5 min in the dark before detection using a Tecan Infinite M1000 Pro microplate reader with 495 nm (10 nm bandwidth) excitation and 530 nm (10 nm bandwidth) emission. A standard curve of DTB was generated from 0 to 80 pmol and used to determine the amount of DTB per sample.
PARÁGRAFO: Seedlings were germinated on control media and transferred to plates containing control or 200 μm cadaverine media for 24, 48, or 72 h before collecting tissue at 8 days after germination. An additional subset of seedlings was germinated directly on control or 200 μm cadaverine media. To harvest, seedlings were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized using a 4.5‐mm steel bead and a Mixmill.
PARÁGRAFO: RNA extraction was done using TRIzol reagent and Direct‐zol RNA MiniPrep Kit, with a chloroform phase separation, according to manufacturer’s specifications (ZymoResearch, Irvine, CA, USA). cDNA synthesis was done using SuperScript III. qRT‐PCR was done using Bullseye EvaGreen qPCR Mastermix (MidSci) and run on a LightCycler 480 II Instrument (Roche). Gene expression was calculated by the delta delta C t method and standardized to the PP2A (At1G59830) reference gene (Czechowski et al., 2005; Ramakers et al., 2003). Fold‐change of expression for all samples was then set relative to a control sample. Statistical significance was identified by ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction (SAS version 9.3).
PARÁGRAFO: Seedling growth is as described above, with seedlings germinated on 1.5% agar, 0.5× LS media pH 5.7 with 1.5% sucrose with or without or 200 μm cadaverine. Tissue was frozen using dry ice after 8 days of growth. Frozen samples were homogenized using MixMill. Protein was extracted in the equivalent of 1 ml of protein extraction buffer (20 mm MOPS [pH 7.5], 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 50 mm Sucrose [Roche inhibitor cocktail tablet], 1 mm DTT, 7% glycerol [adapted from (Li et al., 2012]) per 250 mg of tissue. The homogenate was gently mixed at 4°C for 30 min, then centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min, 18 000  g to pellet the debris. Total protein was quantified and standardized for each gel using the Roche BCA assay. Approximately 150 μg of protein was loaded on to a 12% Tris‐Bis NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and run using the Invitrogen X‐cell SureLock Mini‐Cell Electrophoresis System. After electroblotting, the Immunobilon‐FL PVDF membrane was blocked for 1 h at 4°C with a 5% milk/TBS solution (25 mm Tris‐HCl, 140 mm NaCl, 3.0 mm KCl). Anti‐RPT4A, a proteasome subunit‐specific antibody generated in rabbit, was used as a loading control at 1:4000 dilution. BIO3‐BIO1 antibody was generated against guinea pig by Claude Alban and used at 1:25 000 (Cobessi et al., 2012). BCCP1 and MCCA antibodies were generated against rabbit by Basil Nikolau and obtained from the Plant Antibody Facility (PAF, Ohio State) (Che, 2003; Li et al., 2011). MCCA and BCCP1 antibodies were used at a concentration of 1:10 000. LiCor CW800, secondary antibodies were used according to manufacturer’s instructions at 1:10 000 dilution. Membranes were scanned using LICOR Odyssey. Image studio software version 5.2.5 and Adobe Photoshop was used to quantify band intensity.
PARÁGRAFO: Biotin‐containing proteins were quantified following protocol from Li et al. (2012). RPT4A loading control was used as described above. Membranes were blocked in TBST with 1% Tween20 before treating with streptavidin. Streptavadin CW800 was used to detect biotinylated proteins at a concentration of 0.5 µg ml–1 in 1% milk TBST.
PARÁGRAFO: Col‐0 wild‐type seedlings were grown on LS media as described above. After 5 days in the growth chamber, seedlings were transferred to plates containing control or 200 μm cadaverine media, and allowed to grow for an additional 72 h. Fresh tissue was submerged immediately in 75°C isopropanol with 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene. Lipid extraction procedure was done according to Devaiah et al. (2006). Samples were dried under nitrogen gas and shipped to Kansas State Lipidomics Research Center for analysis (Vu et al., 2014). Lipids were standardized to dry weight for each sample. Total acyl lipids, DAG and TAG were analyzed on a Waters Xevo TQS mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Samples contained 200 seedlings per biological replica, with a total of five biological repeats.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Clinostats are instruments that continuously rotate biological specimens along an axis, thereby averaging their orientation relative to gravity over time. Our previous experiments indicated that low-speed clinorotation may itself trigger directional root tip curvature. In this project, we have investigated the root curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception (pgm) or gravity signal transduction (arg1, toc132) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process.

PARÁGRAFO: Control of biofilms requires rapid methods to identify compounds effective against them and to isolate resistance-compromised mutants for identifying genes involved in enhanced biofilm resistance. While rapid screening methods for microtiter plate well (“static”) biofilms are available, there are no methods for such screening of continuous flow biofilms (“flow biofilms”). Since the latter biofilms more closely approximate natural biofilms, development of a high-throughput (HTP) method for screening them is desirable. We describe here a new method using a device comprised of microfluidic channels and a distributed pneumatic pump (BioFlux) that provides fluid flow to 96 individual biofilms. This device allows fine control of continuous or intermittent fluid flow over a broad range of flow rates, and the use of a standard well plate format provides compatibility with plate readers. We show that use of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria, staining with propidium iodide, and measurement of fluorescence with a plate reader permit rapid and accurate determination of biofilm viability. The biofilm viability measured with the plate reader agreed with that determined using plate counts, as well as with the results of fluorescence microscope image analysis. Using BioFlux and the plate reader, we were able to rapidly screen the effects of several antimicrobials on the viability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms.

PARÁGRAFO: Stationary-phase bacteria are important in disease. The σs-regulated general stress response helps them become resistant to disinfectants, but the role of σs in bacterial antibiotic resistance has not been elucidated. Loss of σs rendered stationary-phase Escherichia coli more sensitive to the bactericidal antibiotic gentamicin (Gm), and proteomic analysis suggested involvement of a weakened antioxidant defense. Use of the psfiA genetic reporter, 3′-(p-hydroxyphenyl) fluorescein (HPF) dye, and Amplex Red showed that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mutant. HPF measurements can be distorted by cell elongation, but Gm did not affect stationary-phase cell dimensions. Coadministration of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) decreased drug lethality particularly in the mutant, as did Gm treatment under anaerobic conditions that prevent ROS formation. Greater oxidative stress, due to insufficient quenching of endogenous ROS and/or respiration-linked electron leakage, therefore contributed to the greater sensitivity of the mutant; infection by a uropathogenic strain in mice showed this to be the case also in vivo. Disruption of antioxidant defense by eliminating the quencher proteins, SodA/SodB and KatE/SodA, or the pentose phosphate pathway proteins, Zwf/Gnd and TalA, which provide NADPH for ROS decomposition, also generated greater oxidative stress and killing by Gm. Thus, besides its established mode of action, Gm also kills stationary-phase bacteria by generating oxidative stress, and targeting the antioxidant defense of E. coli can enhance its efficacy. Relevant aspects of the current controversy on the role of ROS in killing by bactericidal drugs of exponential-phase bacteria, which represent a different physiological state, are discussed.

PARÁGRAFO: Mammalian cells employ an array of biological mechanisms to detect and respond to mechanical loading in their environment. One such mechanism is the formation of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD), which foster a molecular flux across cell membranes that promotes tissue adaptation. Repair of PMD through an orchestrated activity of molecular machinery is critical for cell survival, and the rate of PMD repair can affect downstream cellular signaling. PMD have been observed to influence the mechanical behavior of skin, alveolar, and gut epithelial cells, aortic endothelial cells, corneal keratocytes and epithelial cells, cardiac and skeletal muscle myocytes, neurons, and most recently, bone cells including osteoblasts, periodontal ligament cells, and osteocytes. PMD are therefore positioned to affect the physiological behavior of a wide range of vertebrate organ systems including skeletal and cardiac muscle, skin, eyes, the gastrointestinal tract, the vasculature, the respiratory system, and the skeleton. The purpose of this review is to describe the processes of PMD formation and repair across these mechanosensitive tissues, with a particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting repair mechanisms and downstream signaling to better understand the role of PMD in skeletal mechanobiology. The implications of PMD-related mechanisms for disease and potential therapeutic applications are also explored.

PARÁGRAFO: The ultrastructure and immunohistochemistry of secretory proteins of sublingual glands were studied in mice flown on the US space shuttles Discovery (Space Transportation System [STS]-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). No differences in mucous acinar or serous demilune cell structure were observed between sublingual glands of ground control and flight mice. In contrast, previous studies showed autophagy and apoptosis of parotid serous acinar cells in flight mice. The expression of parotid secretory protein (PSP) in sublingual demilune cells of STS-131 flight mice was significantly increased compared to ground control mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Similarly, mucin (Muc19) expression in acinar cells and PKA-RII expression in demilune cells were increased in STS-131 flight mice and decreased in STS-135 flight mice, but not significantly. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in mice from both flights, and nuclear PKA-RII was slightly increased. These results indicate that the response of salivary glands to spaceflight conditions varies among the different glands, cell types and secretory proteins. Additionally, the spaceflight environment, including the effects of microgravity, modifies protein expression. Determining changes in salivary proteins may lead to development of non-invasive methods to assess the physiological status of astronauts.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Introduction: Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown.
PARÁGRAFO: Methods: In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6 g) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2 days after landing.
PARÁGRAFO: Results: We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene Amy1; however, no increase in Aqp5 and Ano1, which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (Vamp8) and small G proteins, including Rap1 and Rab families, were upregulated under lunar gravity.
PARÁGRAFO: Conclusion: These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8. Our study highlights Amy1 as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Among the many stressors astronauts are exposed to during spaceflight, cosmic radiation may lead to various serious health effects. Specifically, space radiation may contribute to decreased immunity, which has been documented in astronauts during short- and long-duration missions, as evidenced by several changes in cellular immunity and plasma cytokine levels. Reactivation of latent herpes viruses, either directly from radiation of latently infected cells and/or from perturbation of the immune system, may result in disease in astronauts. Epstein‒Barr virus (EBV) is one of the eight human herpes viruses known to infect more than 90% of human adults and persists for the life of the host without normally causing adverse effects. Reactivation of several latent viruses in astronauts is well documented, although the mechanism of reactivation is not well understood. We studied the effect of four different types of radiation, (1) 137Cs gamma rays, (2) 150-MeV protons, (3) 600 MeV/n carbon ions, and (4) 600 MeV/n iron ions on the activation of lytic gene transcription and of reactivation of EBV in a latently infected cell line (Akata) at doses of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. The data showed that for all doses used in this study, lytic gene transcription was induced and median viral loads were significantly higher for all types of radiation than in corresponding control samples, with the increases detected as early as four days post-exposure and generally tapering off at later time points. The viability and size of EBV-infected Akata cells were highly variable and exhibited approximately the same trend in time for all radiation types at 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Gy. This work shows that reactivation of viruses can occur due to the effect of different types of radiation on latently infected cells in the absence of changes or cytokines produced in the immune system. In general, gamma rays are more effective than protons, carbon ions, and iron ions in inducing latent virus reactivation, though these high-energy particles did induce more sustained and later reactivation of EBV lytic gene transcription. These findings also challenge the common relative biological effectiveness concept that is often used in radiobiology for other end points.

PARÁGRAFO: Plant roots navigate in the soil environment following the gravity vector. Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.

PARÁGRAFO: Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) are essential for tissue homeostasis and regeneration, but the potential contribution of MuSC morphology to in vivo function remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that quiescent MuSCs are morphologically heterogeneous and exhibit different patterns of cellular protrusions. We classified quiescent MuSCs into three functionally distinct stem cell states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. We demonstrate that the shift between different stem cell states promotes regeneration and is regulated by the sensing protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 is sufficient to prime MuSCs toward more responsive cells. Piezo1 deletion in MuSCs shifts the distribution toward less responsive cells, mimicking the disease phenotype we find in dystrophic muscles. We further demonstrate that Piezo1 reactivation ameliorates the MuSC morphological and regenerative defects of dystrophic muscles. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of how stem cells respond to injury and identify Piezo1 as a key regulator for adjusting stem cell states essential for regeneration.

PARÁGRAFO: Astronauts are exposed to harsh conditions, including cosmic radiation and microgravity. Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.

PARÁGRAFO: Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging levels within the cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that have been implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a flavonol-specific dye. The expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE, a gene encoding a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell-specific flavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were detected using a fluorescent ROS sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4-2, which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore synthesizes no flavonol antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid ABA-induced closure than the wild type, suggesting that flavonols may dampen the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closing. The levels of flavonols are positively regulated in guard cells by ethylene treatment in the wild type, but not in the ethylene-insensitive2-5 mutant. In addition, in both ethylene-overproducing1 and ethylene-treated wild-type plants, elevated flavonols lead to decreasing ROS and slower ABA-mediated stomatal closure. These results are consistent with flavonols suppressing ROS accumulation and decreasing the rate of ABA-dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene-induced increases in guard cell flavonols modulating these responses.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Angiosperm trees reorient their woody stems by asymmetrically producing a specialized xylem tissue, tension wood, which exerts a strong contractile force resulting in negative gravitropism of the stem. Here, we show, in Populus trees, that initial gravity perception and response occurs in specialized cells through sedimentation of starch-filled amyloplasts and relocalization of the auxin transport protein, PIN3. Gibberellic acid treatment stimulates the rate of tension wood formation and gravibending and enhances tissue-specific expression of an auxin-responsive reporter. Gravibending, maturation of contractile fibers, and gibberellic acid (GA) stimulation of tension wood formation are all sensitive to transcript levels of the Class I KNOX homeodomain transcription factor-encoding gene ARBORKNOX2 (ARK2). We generated genome-wide transcriptomes for trees in which gene expression was perturbed by gravistimulation, GA treatment, and modulation of ARK2 expression. These data were employed in computational analyses to model the transcriptional networks underlying wood formation, including identification and dissection of gene coexpression modules associated with wood phenotypes, GA response, and ARK2 binding to genes within modules. We propose a model for gravitropism in the woody stem in which the peripheral location of PIN3-expressing cells relative to the cambium results in auxin transport toward the cambium in the top of the stem, triggering tension wood formation, while transport away from the cambium in the bottom of the stem triggers opposite wood formation.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth.

PARÁGRAFO: Auxin is transported in plants with distinct polarity, defined by transport proteins of the PIN-formed (PIN) family. Components of the complex trafficking machinery responsible for polar PIN protein localization have been identified by genetic approaches, but severe developmental phenotypes of trafficking mutants complicate dissection of this pathway. We utilized a temperature sensitive allele of Arabidopsis thaliana SCD1 (stomatal cytokinesis defective1) that encodes a RAB-guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Auxin transport, lateral root initiation, asymmetric auxin-induced gene expression after gravitropic reorientation, and differential gravitropic growth were reduced in the roots of the scd1-1 mutant relative to wild type at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, but not at the permissive temperature of 18°C. In scd1-1 at 25°C, PIN1- and PIN2-GFP accumulated in endomembrane bodies. Transition of seedlings from 18 to 25°C for as little as 20 min resulted in the accumulation of PIN2-GFP in endomembranes, while gravitropism and root developmental defects were not detected until hours after transition to the non-permissive temperature. The endomembrane compartments that accumulated PIN2-GFP in scd1-1 exhibited FM4-64 signal colocalized with ARA7 and ARA6 fluorescent marker proteins, consistent with PIN2 accumulation in the late or multivesicular endosome. These experiments illustrate the power of using a temperature sensitive mutation in the gene encoding SCD1 to study the trafficking of PIN2 between the endosome and the plasma membrane. Using the conditional feature of this mutation, we show that altered trafficking of PIN2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature.

We highlight current knowledge and how scientific communities with expertize in viral, cellular, and clinical biology have contributed to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and how these findings may help explain the widely varied clinical observations of COVID-19 patients.

PARÁGRAFO: Microgravity is known to affect the organization of the cytoskeleton, cell and nuclear morphology and to elicit differential expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton, focal adhesions and the extracellular matrix. Although the nucleus is mechanically connected to the cytoskeleton through the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, the role of this group of proteins in these responses to microgravity has yet to be defined. In our study, we used a simulated microgravity device, a 3-D clinostat (Gravite), to investigate whether the LINC complex mediates cellular responses to the simulated microgravity environment. We show that nuclear shape and differential gene expression are both responsive to simulated microgravity in a LINC-dependent manner and that this response changes with the duration of exposure to simulated microgravity. These LINC-dependent genes likely represent elements normally regulated by the mechanical forces imposed by gravity on Earth.

PARÁGRAFO: The ability of terrestrial microorganisms to grow in the near-surface environment of Mars is of importance to the search for life and protection of that planet from forward contamination by human and robotic exploration. Because most water on present-day Mars is frozen in the regolith, permafrosts are considered to be terrestrial analogs of the martian subsurface environment. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from a permafrost borehole in northeastern Siberia capable of growth under conditions of low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere. By 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, all six permafrost isolates were identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium, most closely related to C. inhibens (five isolates) and C. viridans (one isolate). Quantitative growth assays demonstrated that the six permafrost isolates, as well as nine type species of Carnobacterium (C. alterfunditum, C. divergens, C. funditum, C. gallinarum, C. inhibens, C. maltaromaticum, C. mobile, C. pleistocenium, and C. viridans) were all capable of growth under cold, low-pressure, anoxic conditions, thus extending the low-pressure extreme at which life can function.

PARÁGRAFO: Studies of how microorganisms respond to pressure have been limited mostly to the extreme high pressures of the deep sea (i.e., the piezosphere). In contrast, despite the fact that the growth of most bacteria is inhibited at pressures below ∼2.5 kPa, little is known of microbial responses to low pressure (LP). To study the global LP response, we performed transcription microarrays on Bacillus subtilis cells grown under normal atmospheric pressure (∼101 kPa) and a nearly inhibitory LP (5 kPa), equivalent to the pressure found at an altitude of ∼20 km. Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons (AbrB, CcpA, CodY, Fur, IolR, ResD, Rok, SigH, Spo0A). Notably, the highest number of upregulated genes, 86, belonged to the SigB-mediated general stress response (GSR) regulon. Upregulation of the GSR by LP was confirmed by monitoring the expression of the SigB-dependent ctc-lacZ reporter fusion. Measuring transcriptome changes resulting from exposure of bacterial cells to LP reveals insights into cellular processes that may respond to LP exposure.

PARÁGRAFO: The roles of various core components, including α/β/γ-type small acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP), dipicolinic acid (DPA), core water content, and DNA repair by apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases or nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), in Bacillus subtilis spore resistance to different types of ionizing radiation including X rays, protons, and high-energy charged iron ions have been studied. Spores deficient in DNA repair by NHEJ or AP endonucleases, the oxidative stress response, or protection by major α/β-type SASP, DPA, and decreased core water content were significantly more sensitive to ionizing radiation than wild-type spores, with highest sensitivity to high-energy-charged iron ions. DNA repair via NHEJ and AP endonucleases appears to be the most important mechanism for spore resistance to ionizing radiation, whereas oxygen radical detoxification via the MrgA-mediated oxidative stress response or KatX catalase activity plays only a very minor role. Synergistic radioprotective effects of α/β-type but not γ-type SASP were also identified, indicating that α/β-type SASP's binding to spore DNA is important in preventing DNA damage due to reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation.

PARÁGRAFO: Bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus are persistent inhabitants of human spaceflight habitats and represent potential opportunistic pathogens. The effect of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and the frequency of mutations to antibiotic resistance in the model organism Staphylococcus epidermidis strain ATCC12228 was investigated. Six cultures of the test organism were cultivated in biological research in canisters–Petri dish fixation units for 122 h on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the SpaceX-3 resupply mission. Asynchronous ground controls (GCs) consisted of identical sets of cultures cultivated for 122 h in the ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space Center. S. epidermidis exhibited significantly lower viable counts but significantly higher frequencies of mutation to rifampicin (Rif) resistance in space vs. GC cultures. The spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene leading to RifR was altered in S. epidermidis isolates cultivated in the ISS compared to GCs. The results suggest that the human spaceflight environment induces unique physiologic stresses on growing bacterial cells leading to changes in mutagenic potential.

PARÁGRAFO: The ongoing rise in global temperatures poses significant challenges to ecosystems, particularly impacting bacterial communities that are central to biogeochemical cycles. The resilience of wild mesophilic bacteria to temperature increases of 2–4 °C remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted experimental evolution on six wild Bacillus strains from two lineages (Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis) to examine their thermal adaptation strategies. We exposed the bacteria to gradually increasing temperatures to assess their thermal plasticity, focusing on the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation. While B. subtilis lineages improved growth at highly critical temperatures, only one increased its thermal niche to 4 °C above their natural range. This finding is concerning given climate change projections. B. cereus strains exhibited higher mutation rates but were not able to grow at increasing temperatures, while B. subtilis required fewer genetic changes to increase heat tolerance, indicating distinct adaptive strategies. We observed convergent evolution in five evolved lines, with mutations in genes involved in c-di-AMP synthesis, which is crucial for potassium transport, implicating this chemical messenger for the first time in heat tolerance. These insights highlight the vulnerability of bacteria to climate change and underscore the importance of genetic background in shaping thermal adaptation.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Past results have suggested that bacterial antibiotic susceptibility is altered during space flight. To test this notion, Bacillus subtilis cells were cultivated in matched hardware, medium, and environmental conditions either in space flight microgravity on the International Space Station, termed flight (FL) samples, or at Earth-normal gravity, termed ground control (GC) samples. The susceptibility of FL and GC samples was compared to 72 antibiotics and growth-inhibitory compounds using the Omnilog phenotype microarray (PM) system. Only 9 compounds were identified by PM screening as exhibiting significant differences (P < 0.05, Student's t test) in FL versus GC samples: 6-mercaptopurine, cesium chloride, enoxacin, lomefloxacin, manganese(II) chloride, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, and trifluoperazine. Testing of the same compounds by standard broth dilution assay did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) between FL and GC samples. The results indicate that the susceptibility of B. subtilis cells to a wide range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors is not dramatically altered by space flight.
PARÁGRAFO: IMPORTANCE This study addresses a major concern of mission planners for human space flight, that bacteria accompanying astronauts on long-duration missions might develop a higher level of resistance to antibiotics due to exposure to the space flight environment. The results of this study do not support that notion.

PARÁGRAFO: The effect of Bacillus subtilis exposure to the human spaceflight environment on growth, mutagenic frequency, and spectrum of mutations to rifampicin resistance (RifR) was investigated. B. subtilis cells were cultivated in Biological Research in Canister-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) on two separate missions to the International Space Station (ISS), dubbed BRIC-18 and BRIC-21, with matching asynchronous ground controls. No statistically significant difference in either growth or in the frequency of mutation to RifR was found in either experiment. However, nucleotide sequencing of the RifR regions of the rpoB gene from RifR mutants revealed dramatic differences in the spectrum of mutations between flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples, including two newly discovered rpoB alleles in the FL samples (Q137R and L489S). The results strengthen the idea that exposure to the human spaceflight environment causes unique stresses on bacteria, leading to alterations in their mutagenic potential.

PARÁGRAFO: RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a highly conserved macromolecular machine that contributes to the flow of genetic information from genotype to phenotype. In Bacillus subtilis, mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the β-subunit of RNAP have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. In addition, the spectrum of mutations in rpoB leading to rifampin resistance (Rifr) can change dramatically depending upon the environment to which B. subtilis cells or spores are exposed. Rifr rpoB mutations have historically been associated with slower growth and reduced fitness; however, these assessments of fitness were conducted on limited collections of mutants in rich laboratory media that poorly reflect natural environments typically inhabited by B. subtilis. Using a novel deep-sequencing approach in addition to traditional measurements of growth rate, lag time, and pairwise competitions, we demonstrated that the competitive advantages of specific rpoB alleles differ depending on the growth environment in which they are determined.
PARÁGRAFO: IMPORTANCE Microbial resistance to antibiotics is a growing threat to public health across the world. Historically, resistance to antibiotics has been associated with reduced fitness. A growing body of evidence indicates that resistance to rifampin, a frontline antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial and biofilm-associated infections, may increase fitness given an appropriate environment even in the absence of the selective antibiotic. Here, we experimentally confirm this phenomenon by directly comparing the fitness of multiple rifampin-resistant mutants of Bacillus subtilis in rich LB medium and an asparagine minimal medium. Our research demonstrates that the fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The prevailing paradigm of Salmonella enteropathogenesis based on monolayers asserts that Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 Type Three Secretion System (SPI-1 T3SS) is required for bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium. However, little is known about the role of SPI-1 in mediating gastrointestinal disease in humans. Recently, SPI-1 deficient nontyphoidal Salmonella strains were isolated from infected humans and animals, indicating that SPI-1 is not required to cause enteropathogenesis and demonstrating the need for more in vivo-like models. Here, we utilized a previously characterized 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium to elucidate the role of all characterized Salmonella enterica T3SSs. Similar to in vivo reports, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was not required to invade 3-D intestinal cells. Additionally, Salmonella strains carrying single (SPI-1 or SPI-2), double (SPI-1/2) and complete T3SS knockout (SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC) also invaded 3-D intestinal cells to wildtype levels. Invasion of wildtype and TTSS mutants was a Salmonella active process, whereas non-invasive bacterial strains, bacterial size beads, and heat-killed Salmonella did not invade 3-D cells. Wildtype and T3SS mutants did not preferentially target different cell types identified within the 3-D intestinal aggregates, including M-cells/M-like cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. Moreover, each T3SS was necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication within 3-D cells. Collectively, these results indicate that T3SSs are dispensable for Salmonella invasion into highly differentiated 3-D models of human intestinal epithelial cells, but are required for intracellular bacterial growth, paralleling in vivo infection observations and demonstrating the utility of these models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection occurs in differentiating epithelial tissues, and cancers caused by the high-risk types (e.g., HPV16 and HPV18) typically occur at oropharyngeal and anogenital anatomical sites. The HPV life cycle is differentiation-dependent, requiring tissue culture methodology able to recapitulate the three-dimensional (3D) stratified epithelium. Here we report two distinct and complementary methods to grow differentiating epithelial tissues that mimic many critical morphological and biochemical aspects of in vivo tissue. The first approach involves growing primary human epithelial cells on top of a dermal equivalent consisting of collagen fibers and living fibroblast cells. When these cells are grown at the liquid-air interface, differentiation occurs and allows for epithelial stratification. The second approach uses a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. The low-fluid-shear microgravity environment inside the bioreactor allows the cells to use collagen-coated microbeads as a growth scaffold and self assemble into 3D cellular aggregates. These approaches are applied to epithelial cells derived from HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical tissues. The second part of the protocol introduces potential downstream applications for these 3D tissue models.
PARÁGRAFO: We describe methods that will allow readers to start successfully culturing 3D tissues from oral and cervical cells. These tissues have been used for microscopic visualization, scanning-electron microscopy, and large -omics studies to gain insights into epithelial biology, the HPV life cycle, and host-pathogen interactions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease. By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. In this study, we show that a previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon, ydcI or STM1625, encodes a highly conserved DNA binding protein with related homologs present in a range of Gram-negative bacterial genera. Gene expression analysis shows that ydcI is expressed in different bacterial genera and is involved in its autoregulation in S. Typhimurium. We demonstrate that purified YdcI protein specifically binds a DNA probe consisting of its own promoter sequence. We constructed an S. Typhimurium ΔydcI mutant strain and show that this strain is more sensitive to both organic and inorganic acid stress than is an isogenic WT strain, and this defect is complemented in trans. Moreover, our data indicate that ydcI is part of the rpoS regulon related to stress resistance. The S. Typhimurium ΔydcI mutant was able to invade cultured cells to the same degree as the WT strain, but a strain in which ydcI expression is induced invaded cells at a level 2.8 times higher than that of the WT. In addition, induction of ydcI expression in S. Typhimurium resulted in the formation of a biofilm in stationary-phase cultures. These data indicate the ydcI gene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein involved with aspects of prokaryotic biology related to stress resistance and possibly virulence.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Investigation into the causes underlying the rapid, global amphibian decline provides critical insight into the effects of changing ecosystems. Hypothesized and confirmed links between amphibian declines, disease, and environmental changes are increasingly represented in published literature. However, there are few long-term amphibian studies that include data on population size, abnormality/injury rates, disease, and habitat variables to adequately assess changes through time. We cultured and identified microorganisms isolated from abnormal/injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi, to discover potential causative agents responsible for their significant decline in health and population. This organism and our study site were chosen because the population and habitat of C. a. bishopi have been intensively studied from 1969–2009, and the abnormality/injury rate and apparent lack of regeneration were established. Although many bacterial and fungal isolates recovered were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens were identified in association with only the injured tissues of C.a. bishopi. Bacterial isolates included Aeromonas hydrophila, a known amphibian pathogen, Granulicetella adiacens, Gordonai terrae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aerococcus viridans, Streptococcus pneumoniae and a variety of Pseudomonads, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. stutzeri, and P. alcaligenes. Fungal isolates included species in the genera Penicillium, Acremonium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium, Streptomycetes, and the Class Hyphomycetes. Many of the opportunistic pathogens identified are known to form biofilms. Lack of isolation of the same organism from all wounds suggests that the etiological agent responsible for the damage to C. a. bishopi may not be a single organism. To our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia cultured from a Cryptobranchid salamander. The incidence of abnormalities/injury and retarded regeneration in C. a. bishopi may have many contributing factors including disease and habitat degradation. Results from this study may provide insight into other amphibian population declines.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Assessing bacterial behavior in microgravity is important for risk assessment and prevention of infectious diseases during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, this research field allows the unveiling of novel connections between low-fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the spaceflight-induced global transcriptional and proteomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that is present in the space habitat. P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq as a global transcriptional regulator. Since Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator acting across bacterial species. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight were the lecA and lecB lectin genes and the gene for rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), which is involved in rhamnolipid production. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data for this organism grown in microgravity analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Interesting similarities were observed, including, among others, similarities with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism. While RWV-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight presumably adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was most prominent. Whether the observed changes in pathogenesis-related gene expression in response to spaceflight culture could lead to an alteration of virulence in P. aeruginosa remains to be determined and will be important for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and for the general public.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), including avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), pose a considerable threat to both human and animal health, with illness causing substantial economic loss. APEC strain χ7122 (O78∶K80∶H9), containing three large plasmids [pChi7122-1 (IncFIB/FIIA-FIC), pChi7122-2 (IncFII), and pChi7122-3 (IncI2)]; and a small plasmid pChi7122-4 (ColE2-like), has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of ExPEC pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. We previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pChi7122-1 and determined its importance in systemic APEC infection; however the roles of the other pChi7122 plasmids were still ambiguous. Herein we present the sequence of the remaining pChi7122 plasmids, confirming that pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and a putative type IV fimbriae respectively, whereas pChi7122-4 is a cryptic plasmid. New features were also identified, including a gene cluster on pChi7122-2 that is not present in other E. coli strains but is found in Salmonella serovars and is predicted to encode the sugars catabolic pathways. In vitro evaluation of the APEC χ7122 derivative strains with the three large plasmids, either individually or in combinations, provided new insights into the role of plasmids in biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and the interaction of E. coli strains with 3-D cultures of intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, we show that the nature and combinations of plasmids, as well as the background of the host strains, have an effect on these phenomena. Our data reveal new insights into the role of extra-chromosomal sequences in fitness and diversity of ExPEC in their phenotypes.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. An in vitro model for NoV replication remains elusive, making study of the virus difficult. A previous study, which used a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells reported NoV replication and extensive cytopathic effects (CPE). Using the same 3-D model, but with highly purified Norwalk virus (NV), we attempted to replicate this study. Our results showed no evidence of NV replication by real-time PCR of viral RNA or by immunocytochemical detection of viral structural and nonstructural proteins. Immunocytochemical analysis of the 3-D cultures also showed no detectable presence of histo-blood group antigens that participate in NV binding and host tropism. To determine the potential cause of CPE observed in the previous study, we exposed 3-D cultures to lipopolysaccharide concentrations consistent with contaminated stool samples and observed morphologic features similar to CPE. We conclude that the 3-D INT-407 model does not support NV replication.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Low fluid shear force, including that encountered in microgravity models, induces bacterial responses, but the range of bacteria capable of responding to this signal remains poorly characterized. We systematically analyzed a range of Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae for conservation of the low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response using phenotypic assays, qPCR, and targeted mutations. Our results indicate LSMMG response conservation across Enterobacteriacae with potential variance in up- or down-regulation of a given response depending on genus. Based on the data, we analyzed the role of the trp operon genes and the TrpR regulator in the LSMMG response using targeted mutations in these genes in S. Typhimurium and E. coli. We found no alteration of the LSMMG response compared to WT in these mutant strains under the conditions tested here. To our knowledge, this study is first-of-kind for Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia, presents novel data for Escherichia, and provides the first analysis of trp genes in LSMMG responses. This impacts our understanding of how LSMMG affects bacteria and our ability to modify bacteria with this condition in the future.

PARÁGRAFO: Why is a healthy person protected from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, while individuals with cystic fibrosis or damaged epithelium are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic pathogen? In order to address this question, it is essential to thoroughly understand the dynamic interplay between the host microenvironment and P. aeruginosa. Therefore, using modeI systems that represent key aspects of human mucosal tissues in health and disease allows recreating in vivo host-pathogen interactions in a physiologically relevant manner. In this review, we discuss how factors of mucosal tissues, such as apical-basolateral polarity, junctional complexes, extracellular matrix proteins, mucus, multicellular complexity (including indigenous microbiota), and other physicochemical factors affect P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and are thus important to mimic in vitro. We highlight in vitro cell and tissue culture model systems of increasing complexity that have been used over the past 35 years to study the infectious disease process of P. aeruginosa, mainly focusing on lung models, and their respective advantages and limitations. Continued improvements of in vitro models based on our expanding knowledge of host microenvironmental factors that participate in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis will help advance fundamental understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and increase the translational potential of research findings from bench to the patient’s bedside.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: To address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this review describes experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before infection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na+/K+-ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 mortality. Attention to hydration holds potential to reduce COVID-19 mortality and disparities via at least 5 pathways simultaneously.

PARÁGRAFO: Strategies are needed to improve repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with stromal and functional epithelial cells. We demonstrate that decellularized mouse lungs recellularized in a dynamic low fluid shear suspension bioreactor, termed the rotating wall vessel (RWV), contained more cells with decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation and enhanced levels of total RNA compared to static recellularization conditions. These results were observed with two relevant mouse cell types: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). In addition, MSCs cultured in decellularized lungs under static but not bioreactor conditions formed multilayered aggregates. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses suggested differentiation of MSCs into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells in the bioreactor, indicating enhanced potential for remodeling of the decellularized scaffold matrix. In conclusion, dynamic suspension culture is promising for enhancing repopulation of decellularized lungs, and could contribute to remodeling the extracellular matrix of the scaffolds with subsequent effects on differentiation and functionality of inoculated cells.

PARÁGRAFO: Three-dimensional models of human intestinal epithelium mimic the differentiated form and function of parental tissues often not exhibited by two-dimensional monolayers and respond to Salmonella in key ways that reflect in vivo infections. To further enhance the physiological relevance of three-dimensional models to more closely approximate in vivo intestinal microenvironments encountered by Salmonella, we developed and validated a novel three-dimensional co-culture infection model of colonic epithelial cells and macrophages using the NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. First, U937 cells were activated upon collagen-coated scaffolds. HT-29 epithelial cells were then added and the three-dimensional model was cultured in the bioreactor until optimal differentiation was reached, as assessed by immunohistochemical profiling and bead uptake assays. The new co-culture model exhibited in vivo-like structural and phenotypic characteristics, including three-dimensional architecture, apical-basolateral polarity, well-formed tight/adherens junctions, mucin, multiple epithelial cell types, and functional macrophages. Phagocytic activity of macrophages was confirmed by uptake of inert, bacteria-sized beads. Contribution of macrophages to infection was assessed by colonization studies of Salmonella pathovars with different host adaptations and disease phenotypes (Typhimurium ST19 strain SL1344 and ST313 strain D23580; Typhi Ty2). ﻿﻿In addition, Salmonella were cultured aerobically or microaerobically, recapitulating environments encountered prior to and during intestinal infection, respectively﻿. All Salmonella strains exhibited decreased colonization in co-culture (HT-29-U937) relative to epithelial (HT-29) models, indicating antimicrobial function of macrophages. Interestingly, D23580 exhibited enhanced replication/survival in both models following invasion. Pathovar-specific differences in colonization and intracellular co-localization patterns were observed. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related three-dimensional models within a study to identify microenvironmental factors important for regulating infection.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Tissues and organs provide the structural and biochemical landscapes upon which microbial pathogens and commensals function to regulate health and disease. While flat two-dimensional (2-D) monolayers composed of a single cell type have provided important insight into understanding host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, these reductionist models lack many essential features present in the native host microenvironment that are known to regulate infection, including three-dimensional (3-D) architecture, multicellular complexity, commensal microbiota, gas exchange and nutrient gradients, and physiologically relevant biomechanical forces (e.g., fluid shear, stretch, compression). A major challenge in tissue engineering for infectious disease research is recreating this dynamic 3-D microenvironment (biological, chemical, and physical/mechanical) to more accurately model the initiation and progression of host-pathogen interactions in the laboratory. Here we review selected 3-D models of human intestinal mucosa, which represent a major portal of entry for infectious pathogens and an important niche for commensal microbiota. We highlight seminal studies that have used these models to interrogate host-pathogen interactions and infectious disease mechanisms, and we present this literature in the appropriate historical context. Models discussed include 3-D organotypic cultures engineered in the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, extracellular matrix (ECM)-embedded/organoid models, and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) models. Collectively, these technologies provide a more physiologically relevant and predictive framework for investigating infectious disease mechanisms and antimicrobial therapies at the intersection of the host, microbe, and their local microenvironments.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight uniquely alters the physiology of both human cells and microbial pathogens, stimulating cellular and molecular changes directly relevant to infectious disease. However, the influence of this environment on host–pathogen interactions remains poorly understood. Here we report our results from the STL-IMMUNE study flown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-131, which investigated multi-omic responses (transcriptomic, proteomic) of human intestinal epithelial cells to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium when both host and pathogen were simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. To our knowledge, this was the first in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is a common component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of humans. C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 452 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.3% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans–induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed under the conditions of this study. Collectively, our data represent an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during human spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: This report was designed to compare spaceflight-induced cellular and physiological adaptations of Candida albicans cultured in microgravity on the International Space Station across several payloads. C. albicans is a common opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for a variety of superficial infections as well as systemic and more severe infections in humans. Cumulatively, the propensity of this organism to be widespread through the population, the ability to produce disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the tendency to respond to environmental stress with characteristics associated with increased virulence, require a better understanding of the yeast response to microgravity for spaceflight crew safety. As such, the responses of this yeast cultivated during several missions using two in-flight culture bioreactors were analyzed and compared herein. In general, C. albicans had a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity as compared to terrestrial controls. Rates of cell filamentation differed between bioreactors, but were low and not significantly different between flight and terrestrial controls. Viable cells were retrieved and cultured, resulting in a colony morphology that was similar between cells cultivated in flight and in terrestrial control conditions, and in contrast to that previously observed in a ground-based microgravity analog system. Of importance, yeast demonstrated an increased resistance when challenged during spaceflight with the antifungal agent, amphotericin B. Similar levels of resistance were not observed when challenged with the functionally disparate antifungal drug caspofungin. In aggregate, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of characteristics associated with virulence. In addition, and beyond the value of the specific responses of C. albicans to microgravity, this report includes an analysis of biological reproducibility across flight opportunities, compares two spaceflight hardware systems, and includes a summary of general flight and payload timelines.

PARÁGRAFO: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) have experienced rapid development in recent years. The findings of spaceflight-based scRNA-seq and SRT investigations are likely to improve our understanding of life in space and our comprehension of gene expression in various cell systems and tissue dynamics. However, compared to their Earth-based counterparts, gene expression experiments conducted in spaceflight have not experienced the same pace of development. Out of the hundreds of spaceflight gene expression datasets available, only a few used scRNA-seq and SRT. In this perspective piece, we explore the growing importance of scRNA-seq and SRT in space biology and discuss the challenges and considerations relevant to robust experimental design to enable growth of these methods in the field.

PARÁGRAFO: For decades, the health risks associated with space exploration have been increasingly documented and characterized. For some of these risks, countermeasures have been sufficiently developed to sustain human health in low-Earth orbit, the orbital distance from Earth that includes the International Space Station (ISS). However, as humankind plans for a permanent presence on the moon and seeks to advance to Mars, the limits to our countermeasures and the research gaps that have insofar remained unaddressed will create health challenges that rival the engineering challenges of long-duration space missions.
PARÁGRAFO: To gain a comprehensive understanding of how spaceflight affects the human body, the molecular responses of the body to spaceflight factors must be robustly profiled. Recent advances in omics technologies have already revolutionized our approach to understanding disease1,2,3 and have created new pathways for tackling health challenges on Earth.4,5,6 However, the spaceflight environment presents a unique set of factors where the genomic impact is largely unknown. Furthermore, the microgravity and radiation environment of space remains difficult to model on Earth. Therefore, given that the opportunities to study the influence of spaceflight on the human genome have historically been, and still are, limited, it is of paramount importance to perform all omics experiments in spaceflight to the highest standards.
PARÁGRAFO: The ISS is currently the only research laboratory available off-world and the source of the majority of spaceflight omics experiments performed to date. Most mammalian omics studies aboard the ISS have used Mus musculus, the standard laboratory rodent, as a model organism.7 To scale the number of mammalian studies performed in space, NASA launched their rodent research (RR) program in 2014, with the first omics experiment published in the NASA funded GeneLab database in 2015.8,9 Since the program began, the RR program has launched over a dozen missions generating a steady stream of new omics data on a variety of murine tissues and cell systems. These missions have proven essential for understanding the molecular response of terrestrial life to the environmental stressors of space by providing gene expression data for a subset of mouse tissues. These studies have helped illuminate changes within biological systems including the mitochondria,10 musculoskeletal system,11 circadian rhythm,12 and microRNA (miRNA) profiles.13
PARÁGRAFO: The majority of experiments from rodent tissue obtained via the RR missions have been subject to bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), where the whole tissue is homogenized and RNA is extracted. Bulk transcriptomic assays are currently the most common omics assay performed in space biology, with more than 270 transcriptomic datasets available from spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue experiments in the NASA GeneLab database.7 Of these studies, microarray-based experiments have been used to obtain approximately half of the gene expression data stored in GeneLab. As the cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) decreased, RNA-seq started to replace microarrays as the predominant method for spaceflight transcriptomic studies. However, given recent advances in the field of genomics, bulk RNA-seq is being displaced by higher-resolution methods rapidly on Earth. State-of-the-art tools can now resolve gene expression at the single-cell level via single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)14 or maintain 2D topography via spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT).15 While these two types of approaches are becoming standard practice for gene expression research conducted on Earth, the collection protocols for cells and tissues obtained from experiments in spaceflight have not yet been optimized for the application of these methods.
PARÁGRAFO: In this perspective piece, we present the current status of scRNA-seq and SRT in spaceflight experiments, the optimal tissue preservation protocols that should be implemented to ensure the success of these experiments, and the downstream computational tools that are used to obtain high-resolution gene expression insights.
PARÁGRAFO: In less than a decade, the field of scRNA-seq has matured and produced multiple robust protocols for examining the gene expression of individual cells. This has resulted in a paradigm shift in the field of transcriptomics that has enabled the identification of new cell types, uncovered rare cell populations, revealed cellular heterogeneity, charted cell-lineage trajectories during development and disease, and profiled the perturbation of cellular states.16,17,18,19,20,21
PARÁGRAFO: scRNA-seq also has great potential when applied to cell systems and tissues exposed to spaceflight. While gene expression changes have been observed in cell systems and tissues, the exact cell populations driving these expression differences have not yet been characterized. For example, large changes in gene expression have been observed in the murine retina,22 but the differences attributable to specific retinal subpopulations, such as rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, retinal ganglion cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells, have yet to be pinpointed. Similarly, differences in immune function have been observed during spaceflight in the past,23,24,25 where the application of scRNA-seq would have enabled further dissection of specific gene expression differences in the cell populations of, for example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thymus tissue, and bone marrow. Overall, the possibility of identifying exact cell populations that are dysregulated during spaceflight enables the development of more precise therapeutics and countermeasures.
PARÁGRAFO: While there is a spectrum of approaches for scRNA-seq that have been applied across ground-based experiments, only two platforms (Chromium by 10X Genomics and Rhapsody Single-Cell Analysis System by BD Biosciences) have been applied to samples flown in spaceflight.26,27 These were applied to two experiments: the second rodent research reference mission (RRRM-2) and the NASA Twins Study. In both, single-cell suspensions were obtained, cells were physically isolated from one another, and polyadenylated mRNA was captured using oligo(dT)s that were uniquely labeled per cell to differentiate mRNA of different cells in the experiment.
PARÁGRAFO: In the RRRM-2 experiment, 40 mice were flown to the ISS and were part of four distinct groups distinguished by age, duration spent on the ISS, and whether the animal was ISS-terminal or Earth-acclimatized after live animal return (LAR) (Figure 1A). A matching set of 40 mice were also housed on Earth to serve as a ground control. Out of the 80 mice between the ground control and spaceflight groups, 16 animals that were part of the LAR group were selected for single-cell sequencing. Single-cell sequencing of spleen tissue, PBMCs, humerus bone marrow, and femur bone marrow was performed using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. Data for these experiments are publicly available in GeneLab28,29,30,31 (Table 1) and analysis of these datasets is underway in NASA’s Analysis Working Groups (https://genelab.nasa.gov/awg/charter).
PARÁGRAFO: scRNA-seq datasets from spaceflight samples
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Design for the rodent research reference mission 2 (RRRM-2) experiment. In RRRM-2, two age groups of mice were launched to the ISS. After 32 days, half of the mice from each age group returned to Earth, where they lived 24 additional days before dissection. This was time-matched with the remaining groups of mice in orbit, which were euthanized and frozen in-flight. Sixteen mice total were selected for scRNA-seq using the 10X Genomics platform. Four cell/tissue types were selected for scRNA-seq, and they each have an associated GeneLab Dataset (GLDS) publicly available: femur bone marrow (GLDS-402), humerus bone marrow (GLDS-403), PBMCs (GLDS-404), and spleen tissue (GLDS-405).
PARÁGRAFO: (B) PBMCs from human blood were obtained before and after spaceflight on the ISS as part of the NASA Twins Study. Whole blood was obtained using venipuncture into a sodium citrate cell processing tube (CPT) and PBMCs were obtained from the buffy coat after centrifugation of the CPT.
PARÁGRAFO: scRNA-seq datasets from spaceflight
PARÁGRAFO: A complete list of scRNA-seq datasets from samples exposed to spaceflight. Four datasets are from the RRRM-2 mission and are available on GeneLab. One dataset is from the NASA Twin Study and is part of the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Due to privacy concerns around human genomic data, the Twin Study data is not publicly available but can be requested. The LSDA has a public-facing portal where data requests can be initiated (https://nlsp.nasa.gov/explore/entryform/lsda_data_requests/lsda_data_requests). The LSDA team provides the appropriate processes, tools, and secure infrastructure for archival of experimental data and dissemination while complying with applicable rules, regulations, policies, and procedures governing the management and archival of sensitive data and information.
PARÁGRAFO: The only other published experiment that has used scRNA-seq from a spaceflight study is the NASA Twins Study.32 In this experiment, a set of identical twins participated in a set of omics assays. One twin served as a ground control and remained on Earth while the other twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS. For scRNA-seq, whole blood was collected via venipuncture into cell processing tubes (CPTs) containing sodium citrate as a preservative (Figure 1B). The CPTs were returned immediately to the lab and centrifuged to collect PBMCs. The BD Biosciences Single-Cell Analysis System was used to collect single-cell expression data (Table 1). One important caveat to this study is that there was no in-flight time point, and blood was collected for scRNA-seq pre-launch and post-landing.13,33 The time it takes to return cargo, such as CPTs, to Earth is one of the factors limiting the ease of single-cell experiments. CPTs can be spun-down and frozen before returning to Earth, but this direct freezing process will lyse cells. With cell lysis, it is still possible to generate a sample-wide RNA-seq profile but not at single-cell resolution. To generate single-cell profiles from spaceflight samples, cells will need to be either returned to Earth immediately or cells will need to be preserved using a process that prevents lysis.
PARÁGRAFO: While scRNA-seq has greatly improved gene expression experiments, it does have one major limitation: the loss of locational information due to breakdown of tissues into single-cell suspensions. This makes it difficult to identify gene expression changes that may correlate with the topology of the tissue and limits our ability to decipher cell-to-cell interactions and microenvironment-level changes. In order to retain locational information, a variety of SRT methods have been developed in recent years (see Table 2 for a list of recent SRT methods)15,34,35 and applied to a range of sample and tissue types.36,37,38,39
PARÁGRAFO: SRT methods
PARÁGRAFO: An evolving list of SRT methods. Acronyms used: ISS, in situ sequencing; LCM-seq, laser capture microdissection; TIVA, transcriptome in vivo analysis; HDST, high definition spatial transcriptomics; FF, flash frozen; FFPE, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded. Note that this list is not extensive, and there are several more SRT approaches available. Preference was given to newly developed or unique methods.
PARÁGRAFO: Due to various complexities in data collection and analysis, SRT methods are less mature than scRNA-seq methods. Additionally, because of the requirement that tissues remain intact during the SRT workflow, these methods are also more sensitive to the tissue types and structures selected for study. This poses an extra challenge when SRT methods are to be applied to legacy space-flown samples that were collected and stored without planning SRT studies from the start of the missions and their morphology is not fully preserved. For these reasons, we believe improvements can be made in the tissue collection process to better preserve tissue morphology. Specifically, when designing future studies to be performed in spaceflight, where specimens will undergo SRT analysis, experiments should first be optimized on Earth before being translated to experiments performed in space. The overall testing cycle for SRT techniques can be divided into three phases: (1) tissue evaluation, (2) tissue preparation, and (3) 2D RNA analysis.
PARÁGRAFO: Tissue evaluation will require selection of the proper area of interest of the tissue, which may vary in length, width, and thickness depending on the SRT method of interest. Tissue preparation will require testing to determine the optimal duration of exposure to the fixative agent, which may vary depending on tissue type and method of fixation (e.g., flash frozen [FF], formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded [FFPE] tissue, or a different method). It should be noted that most SRT methods to date have been validated with FF and FFPE tissues (Table 2). The third phase, 2D RNA analysis, will analyze the RNA spatial distribution in the tissue under study by applying one of the SRT methods available at the time of the experiment (Table 2). Due to the scarce availability of tissues flown in spaceflight, it is critical that SRT researchers employ a testing cycle before proceeding to their spaceflight samples.
PARÁGRAFO: Good sample preservation is instrumental to the application of scRNA-seq and SRT on tissues from spaceflight. This stands in contrast to bulk RNA-seq, where RNA is collected and pooled from hundreds of thousands to millions of cells. The sheer volume of RNA collected from these many cells means that partial tissue degradation can occur and still yield enough RNA for sequencing. The tolerance threshold for RNA degradation is much lower for scRNA-seq and SRT due to the high-resolution nature of these methods, compared to bulk RNA-seq. For scRNA-seq and SRT, sufficient RNA for sequencing must be obtained from a smaller number of cells.
PARÁGRAFO: RNA is known to degrade quickly and can undergo rapid profile changes and degradation in relatively short periods of time resulting in measurable differences within 5 to 10 min of remaining at room temperature postmortem.57 Additionally, RNA that is not preserved rapidly is subject to degradation that can create distinct RNA-seq profiles, and different RNA transcripts can degrade at different rates.58,59 To account for this, samples intended for scRNA-seq must be preserved rapidly after euthanasia. If the experiment requires single-cell sequencing, the cells should be immediately placed in cryopreservation media and slowly brought to freezing temperature to ensure cells do not lyse during the freezing process. Additionally, tissues should be dissociated prior to freezing. Dissociation after freezing is likely to cause damage to cell membranes and increase the likelihood of RNA leakage due to the stresses of the freezing process.
PARÁGRAFO: An alternative to immediate dissociation is the application of single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) where isolation of nuclei can be performed on frozen material, and the nuclei are subsequently used as input for single-cell sequencing.60 In this case, tissue samples can forgo cryopreservation media and should be brought down to freezing temperatures as quickly as possible, ideally snap-freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen if available. Comparisons of snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq in mouse lungs have shown that they have similar gene detection rates, and dissociation bias is reduced in snRNA-seq.61 Likewise, comparisons in kidneys showed similar gene detection rates.62 The recently completed Fly Cell Atlas63 utilized snRNA-seq instead of scRNA-seq because it can be applied consistently even in problematic tissue type (e.g., antennae, wings, fat bodies) and multinucleated cells (e.g., muscle) and because 70%–90% of transcriptomic information is retained with snRNA-seq.63 Moreover, nuclei can be applied as input for single-cell multiomics studies where both the RNA and chromatin accessibility information is captured from the same nucleus simultaneously. Thus, this approach can be extended in spaceflight experiments in the future.
PARÁGRAFO: Similarly, samples intended for SRT should be frozen immediately after dissection, ideally in a protective embedding medium. This approach preserves both RNA quality and morphology of the tissue. Most of legacy tissues obtained from the ISS did not undergo immediate embedding and freezing for morphology preservation. In the majority of cases, individual organs were not dissected in-flight, but instead were frozen as a whole carcass on the ISS. These samples were returned to Earth where they were thawed, dissected, and re-frozen until ready for downstream sequencing approaches, mostly in bulk. Due to the necessity of organ dissection back in the laboratory on Earth, many rodent samples exposed to the space environment have undergone this double-freezing procedure.64,65,66,67,68 However, this process might lead to partial RNA degradation and deformation of cell and tissue anatomical shape if specific strategies for tissue morphology preservation were not taken into account at the time of freezing. Any deformation can make application of spatial methods very challenging and, in some cases, unfit for SRT methods.
PARÁGRAFO: There is also evidence that whole-carcass preservation leads to different gene expression profiles than tissues dissected in-flight. One study has demonstrated that whole-carcass preservation in-flight leads to greater variability in RNA integrity numbers (RINs) than tissue dissected in-flight.69 Another study compared bulk RNA-seq profiles between mouse liver tissue dissected and frozen directly on the ISS compared to mice preserved as frozen whole carcasses with their liver tissue dissected back on Earth.70 This study notes that whole-carcass preservation in RNAlater can better preserve the tissues; however, there are a few caveats to this approach. The first caveat is that RNAlater has only had limited success in preserving cells for scRNA-seq on Earth71 and will require further optimization before its application can be recommended for such experiments in spaceflight. The second consideration is that RNAlater can induce a unique gene expression response due to the sulfates present in the solution.72 These gene expression responses may be uneven in SRT methods due to the diffusion gradient generated as RNAlater disperses across a tissue. Third, RNAlater is not a fixative agent and has not been tested to our knowledge at the time of writing for compatibility with fixative reagents used in various SRT methods.
PARÁGRAFO: Despite the uncertainties in using RNAlater in scRNA-seq and SRT experiments, there is precedent for preserving nucleic acids with RNAlater on the ISS for other sequencing experiments (Table 3). Other reagents with a success in preserving cells and/or nucleic acids on the ISS include using NOTOXhisto, 10% neutral buffer formation (NBF), 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and the sequential use of trypsin followed by RNAprotect (Table 3). However, these preservatives are not necessarily suitable for scRNA-seq and SRT due to the lack of testing with scRNA-seq and SRT platforms or due to cell lysis that occurs during the preservation process. The current options with a track record on the ISS are the slow and fast freeze methods to store the tissue at a temperature that will preserve RNA and spatial tissue structure. −80°C freezers available on the ISS can be used to bring tissues down to freezing temperatures, but without a snap-freezing step, this process occurs slowly. To solve this problem, a rapid-freeze instrument was added to the ISS to rapidly bring sample temperatures down to −185°C, to compete with snap-freezing methods that make use of liquid nitrogen that is easily available and safely applied on Earth but not a safe option in a space-based lab73,74,75,76 (Table 3).
PARÁGRAFO: Preservation strategies aboard the ISS
PARÁGRAFO: A list of strategies used for cell, tissue, and nucleic acids preservations that have been previously used in experiments in spaceflight.
PARÁGRAFO: There are two options that can help address these challenges moving forward: in-flight tissue dissection and LAR. In-flight tissue dissection will allow tissues of interest to be rapidly frozen, as smaller pieces of tissue freeze faster than a whole carcass, and will avoid the double freeze-thaw that tissues undergo if they are dissected from a frozen carcass back on Earth. The drawback to this approach is that tissue dissection is time-intensive and will require specialized crew training to teach dissection competency. Despite the time commitment required for in-flight dissection, it has been performed in select cases, such as hindlimb dissection during the RR-6 mission,92 though the data from this in-flight dissection are not publicly available. The second approach, LAR, returns organisms to Earth while still alive where they are euthanized after returning to a ground-based lab.93,94 This allows tissues to be preserved according to the highest standards but presents a different set of limitations. Using LAR, organisms have their circadian rhythms disrupted and experience the stressful conditions of atmospheric re-entry. Moreover, depending on the study design of the mission, LAR organisms have the opportunity to begin reacclimating to Earth’s gravity and radiation landscape. Therefore, all three aspects can impact their transcriptomic profiles.
PARÁGRAFO: Overall, in spite of the associated limitations, using one of these two options will help circumvent some of the challenges related to the applicability of scRNA-seq and SRT methods on spaceflight samples.
PARÁGRAFO: After the challenge of achieving more rigorous preservation standards for scRNA-seq and SRT methods is met, the next goal should be to increase the capabilities of molecular biology experiments in space. Ideally, RNA extractions, PCR, and even scRNA-seq and SRT itself should be performed during spaceflight. Achieving this will require the development of workflows compatible with microgravity and more sophisticated workstations for performing molecular biology experiments.
PARÁGRAFO: The capabilities for performing molecular biology experiments have increased dramatically over the past decade. In 2016, the first biomolecule sequencer, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, was demonstrated to work in microgravity aboard the ISS.95 Since then, the repertoire of molecular biology experiments performed in-flight has expanded to include environmental microbial sampling, plasmid transformation, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and library prep.96,97,98 While the original biomolecular sequencer study sequenced Mus musculus DNA libraries (prepared on Earth),95 others have been primarily defined in scope of microbial organisms and not to multicellular model organisms, such as C. elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Mus musculus, or to human samples. In order to build a spaceflight lab capable of performing scRNA-seq and SRT (methods that are most frequently applied to multicellular organisms) the molecular biology pipeline for handling tissues post-dissection throughout the sequencing process must be more well defined.
PARÁGRAFO: Additionally, due to the sensitive nature of RNA, additional laboratory decontamination protocols may need translation to spaceflight. RNase inhibitors will need to be available to wipe down workstations, pipettes, gloves, and any other surfaces the sample may come in contact with. A microbially decontaminated environment would also enhance the quality of RNA obtained, particularly the use of 70% ethanol, isopropanol, or another disinfectant, given the microbe-rich surfaces aboard the ISS.96,97,99 However, the use of ethanol and isopropanol on the ISS is an issue because aerosolized alcohol interferes with the environmental control and life support systems (ECLSSs) in the closed-loop space station environment (J. Perry et al., 2016, 46th International Conference on Environmental Systems, conference).
PARÁGRAFO: Moreover, the workstation used for handling samples should have minimal airflow that would pass dust or other airborne particulates across the workstation. Some of these considerations may be met via use of the Microgravity Science Glovebox100 aboard the ISS to control airflow and by using benzalkonium chloride (BZK) wipes in place of alcohol-based disinfectants. Establishing and following general guidelines, regularly applied when preparing samples for scRNA-seq and SRT, will help create consistency in sample retrieval, prevent RNA degradation, and obtain high-quality data from spaceflight samples in which RNA quantity and quality are not compromised. One caveat to performing scRNA-seq and SRT methods in spaceflight is that it will require additional crew time to complete experiments that are typically done on Earth after sample return. Robotic automation can help overcome these challenges by reducing the amount of time that crew will need to spend executing experiments (Figure 2A). For example, automated imaging has already been performed aboard the ISS.101 Additionally, automation of library preparation steps has been performed on Earth from a spatially barcoded chip array similar to the 10X Genomics Visium format102 as well as from 10X Genomics Visium arrays.103 However, due to strict volume and mass limitations in-flight, compact solutions may need to be investigated, as would specific testing to accommodate microgravity-driven changes in fluidic behavior. Automating these processes and translating them to spaceflight-compatible hardware will alleviate potential time-costs placed on the crew by performing these experiments in-flight in their entirety.
PARÁGRAFO: Computational analysis of spatial transcriptomics data
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Shows the flow of data that could be unlocked with increased computational automation. The right column shows sequential steps of proposed computational automation onboard spacecraft, with the dotted lines to boxes on the left showing opportunities to transfer data back to Earth.
PARÁGRAFO: (B) Example of data analysis workflow from the 10X Genomics Visium on the “Mouse Brain Serial Section 2 (Sagittal-Posterior)” dataset available through the 10X Genomics Dataset portal (https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets). Dataset analyzed with Seurat.
PARÁGRAFO: Another challenge involves the abundance of data generated by sequencing and imaging experiments, which would all need to be stored in-flight and downlinked to Earth. This is particularly relevant to SRT data, which involves either the generation of large fastq files or multiple high-resolution images. To mitigate data downlink challenges, automated software pipelines could be executed in-flight and could convert data into formats with decreased file size. This processed data could then be downlinked to Earth instead of larger, raw files. Thus, onboard data processing could decrease delays in data analysis caused by the transfer of large files. Full transcriptomics analysis pipelines could even be conducted in space, where results, such as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways, could be automatically extracted from transcriptomic data in-flight (Figure 2A). Additionally, these results could also be used as feedback to optimize experimental parameters in-flight and increase the quality of future transcriptomic experiments performed in space.
PARÁGRAFO: Transcriptomic analyses for bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq are relatively well defined compared to SRT. For bulk RNA-seq, NASA GeneLab has developed an RNA-seq consensus pipeline (RCP) to standardize processing of short-read RNA-seq data,104 which builds upon standard recommendations in the field.105 The RCP is accessible at the NASA GeneLab_Data_Processing Github repository. However, a standardized pipeline for scRNA-seq is not yet available from NASA GeneLab or international space omics consortia, such as ISSOP (International Standards for Space Omics Processing) or the ESA-funded Space Omics Topical Team. Data analysis for scRNA-seq presents many unique challenges related to inferring cell trajectories, clustering cell types, identifying and filtering doublets (when two cells are mistakenly considered as a single cell), handling of sparsity in gene expression count tables, and defining flexible statistical frameworks for discovering complex differential patterns in gene expression.106 Despite these challenges, standardized methods, analysis frameworks, and tutorials are available,107,108,109 which can be extended to analysis of data from space flight experiments.
PARÁGRAFO: In comparison, the establishment of best practices for the analysis of SRT data is a work in progress. The advent of SRT allows for solving the spatial distribution of transcripts, as well as locating cell types and cell states in complex tissues, organs, and organoids. Standardizing analysis across a wide variety of tissue configurations and the large number of emerging technologies is a difficult and complex task. Knowledge of the types of software tools available for each method can help inform experimental selection decisions about which SRT method best matches the specific scientific questions under investigation.
PARÁGRAFO: Widely, there are two types of SRT data: single-cell resolution and multi-cell pixel resolution. SRT single-cell resolution data enable the researchers to quantify absolute transcript counts per cell and produce cell gene count tables comparable to scRNA-seq experiments. However, the data are often imaging-based and thus limited in the amount of genes detected in one experiment. On the other hand, the SRT multi-cell pixel resolution data present multiple cells per region of interest and use cell type deconvolution algorithms and label transfer/projection from additional reference scRNA-seq datasets to resolve the cell type composition of the whole-transcriptome region of interest. Regardless of the resolution level of the SRT technique selected, available software packages, for example Seurat110 and Squidpy,111 offer compatibility with several SRT technologies because the structure of the data is similar, meaning that the majority of information comes from transcript counts. Spatial coordinates and cell-level information can be stored as metadata portions of the data object. Both tools include methods for QC (quality control) and preprocessing, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization in spatial coordinates and finding spatially variable and spatial marker genes (Figure 2B). However, these do not support data processing and analysis for all SRT methods.
PARÁGRAFO: Specialized tools have also been developed for cluster analysis,112,113 fusion transcript detection,114 visualization,115 deconvolution of cell-type mixtures,116 inference of extracellular interacting genes,117 identification of sub-tissue architecture/anatomization, finding spatially variable genes,118,119,120 quantifying spatial heterogeneity,121 imputation of missing mRNA expression,122 or improvement of gene expression quantification using spatial, temporal and experimental coordinates. Moreover, comprehensive tools such as STutility builds on the Seurat framework to facilitate analyzing and visualizing multiple samples from the 10X Genomics Visium platform.123 Integration across data types also gives these tools increased investigative potential. For example, integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, achieved with tools such as cell2location124 and stereoscope125 to name a few, can enhance spatial transcriptomics resolution to an unprecedented level.126 Moreover, integration of gene expression data with histology information and spatial location using machine learning (ML) is also under active research.127 For instance, the framework Squidpy is interconnected with Scanpy and the ML Python ecosystem.111
PARÁGRAFO: Despite these advances, challenges associated with metadata standards and data processing exist, including reliable cell segmentation, cell-type identification, integration of expression patterns to anatomical features, finding complex patterns, integration of data from different specimens, time points or perturbations, development of standardized metrics and benchmarks, as well as integration across multiple technologies.128 Other analytical challenges remain for the analysis of SRT data, including those related to sample mapping and image registration and segmentation, data representation, imputation of sparse spatial data, integration of multi-modal data, and automatic inference of knowledge for the combination of tissue structure and molecular data.111
PARÁGRAFO: While the above challenges exist for both terrestrial and spaceflight SRT data, some are more specific to spaceflight studies due to the problems related to sample collection and processing, such as the formation of ice crystals,129 which can cause morphology changes and tissue damage leading to altered spatial information. In data derived from spaceflight experiments, true morphological and transcriptional variability that results from exposure to microgravity and radiation should not be confused with artifacts created by sample collection, preservation, and transportation. Therefore, if artifacts due to confounding factors cannot be sufficiently minimized via sample processing protocols or specific experimental design, software tools aiming to remove confounding factors (for example, cells affected by ice crystals), improve transcript quantification, and reconstruct morphology and architecture of damaged tissue using image processing techniques will be essential. Specifically, reconstruction of deformed images using image registration or image deconvolution/restoration techniques and the development of computational tools to elucidate space-driven modification of tissue organization will warrant investigation.
PARÁGRAFO: The aging ISS, destined to reach its end of life by 2030, has catalyzed an era of “commercial space,” which promises rapid development of the final frontier. To avoid a gap in continuous human presence in space, four private companies are aiming to build and operate commercial space stations in low-Earth orbit. Axiom Space will launch and attach the first segment of its modular space station to the ISS in 2024 and build the remainder of the station while attached to the ISS. The completed Axiom Station will detach to become a free flier by 2030 (https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/nasa-details-intent-to-replace-the-international-space-station-with-a-commercial-space-station-by-2030/). Blue Origin has partnered with Sierra Space to build Orbital Reef, while StarLab will be born out of a partnership between Nanoracks, Voyager Space, and Lockheed Martin. The fourth, yet to be named, space station development effort is being led by Northrup Grumman (https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-signs-agreement-with-nasa-to-design-space-station-for-low-earth-orbit). Furthermore, advances in rocket technology, including reusable engines, have lowered launch costs significantly and increased the cadence of spaceflights to and from the ISS. For example, SpaceX Crew-4 launched to the ISS less than 2 days after Ax-1, Axiom’s private astronaut mission to the ISS, returned to Earth.
PARÁGRAFO: Research in space has been fundamental to our understanding of how to survive and thrive in the weightless environment. Our knowledge and sophistication of scientific investigations in space is continuously strengthened by advances in hardware technology and operations. Numerous hardware options for biological investigations that require cell culture capabilities and maintenance of live specimen in spaceflight, for instance, are already available. A few examples of include Biopack,130 SABL from BioServe Space Technologies (T. Niederwieser, 2015, 45th International Conference on Environmental Systems, conference), Kubik,131 NanoRacks Frame-3, STaARS-1 EF132, and the CubeLab from Space Tango.133 A more current system called the ScienceTaxi (https://www.yurigravity.com/our-service) developed by Yuri Gravity can be integrated into the ISS and into the newer stations coming online; an autonomous version of the ScienceTaxi is in development. This small sampling of hardware options is indicative of the demand for laboratory equipment that is operational in a weightless space environment and the importance of biological experiments conducted in space.
PARÁGRAFO: Now, in this new era of commercial space with new space stations in development, there is an unprecedented opportunity to leverage past research experiences in space to re-think and re-design future technologies and laboratories for spaceflight investigations that are on-par with Earth technologies, yet not limited by gravity-based thinking. For example, the speed of technology and methodology innovation for scRNA-seq and SRT is advancing the field rapidly for terrestrial investigations. Future scRNA-seq and SRT methodologies will enable simultaneous multi-omic measurements from individual cells and spatial regions. The potential of these developments has already been commercially realized for single-cell methodologies by 10X Genomics, whose Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kits offer simultaneous measurement of scRNA-seq and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) data from the same group of cells.134,135 Similar developments are in motion for SRT where co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue section via NGS has already been achieved.51 Moreover, spatially resolved ATAC-seq has been developed,136,137 but does not yet allow for simultaneous measurement of RNA. Given the trajectory of the single-cell and spatial fields toward simultaneous measurements of multiple genomic features, it is anticipated that the need for improved cell and tissue preservation protocols in spaceflight will persist.
PARÁGRAFO: In addition to these creative workarounds, there is an opportunity to design and invent new paradigms for conducting omics and other biological research in space. Space scientists must define the requirements for on-orbit research protocols and outline the specific types of research investigations important to conduct in space, the tools and capabilities necessary for those space investigations, and the criteria for acceptable high-quality science on orbit. These requirements will serve as a guide for commercial space station developers in defining their own orbital lab designs, including hardware capabilities and services. Armed with an understanding of the types of equipment required to conduct the research, commercial space station developers would be better equipped to consider partnerships with terrestrial technology developers that are leading the rapid advances in omics technology and encourage them to adapt their technologies for a weightless space environment by developing future iterations of their technology with space constraints in mind.
PARÁGRAFO: Although launch costs are reducing and launch frequency is increasing, these costs based on mass and volume are still substantial and prohibitive. Offering end-to-end omics capabilities on orbit that are grounded in the concept of “cloud labs” will be a paradigm shift for space research and science. Cloud labs are essentially a virtual lab bench that allow the scientist to control the wet-lab experiment virtually and execute it remotely via an orchestra of automated robotic systems.138 Presently on the ISS and likely in the foreseeable future, several key operational constraints limit rapid, repeatable research in orbit: (1) limited human-tended time for executing experimental protocols, (2) variability in the on-orbit operator’s scientific and technical experience and expertise, (3) a large distance between the principal investigator (PI) and the scientific payload, and (4) inability to rapidly iterate on experimental protocols in real-time. A cloud lab in space will enable the PI to (1) control the experiment via the virtual lab bench, (2) conduct high-quality science by eliminating a variety of confounding variables that are introduced by returning samples to the ground for processing, and (3) iterate on the scientific protocol based on real-time observations of data. Furthermore, on-orbit edge processing and cloud-computing capabilities will accelerate data analysis whereby processed results can be returned to the PI via a secure downlink from the space station. Addition of such capabilities will eliminate the need for large data downloads—a practice that is slow, costly, and requires extremely high bandwidths.
PARÁGRAFO: While an upfront investment of capital is required for a state-of-the-art orbital lab, a high return on investment can be expected. Improved on-orbit capabilities that are easier to access and operate will generate greater interest in space-based research investigations, which in turn will increase the demand to leverage spaceflight as an extreme environment for research—for example, the general adaptability of the human body, which may result in the discovery of new molecular mechanisms. It is expected that the reduction in costs to execute orbital science will translate into lower prices for the researcher, thereby generating even greater interest in space. Taken together, these developments will drive a feedforward loop toward greater insights for extending humanity’s footprint in space and improving life on the ground.
PARÁGRAFO: Even with rapid advances in genomics and spaceflight technology, experimentation in space will remain costly and time-consuming in the foreseeable future. Thus, careful design of experiments is crucial. One factor that may alleviate the risk of these experiments is in silico modeling. Perturbations on transcription and gene expression can be modeled using ML algorithms to test hypotheses prior to launching an experiment into space.139 Adapting these models to be more amenable to the environmental factors of spaceflight can help use limited spaceflight resources more efficiently. Additionally, to aid with experimental design, a specific SRT method should be selected before experiment launch to implement its optimized tissue preservation protocol, and the development status of available computational tools should be rigorously assessed to understand the expected analysis types and data resolutions available. Given the rapid advancements in SRT analysis, ideal tools and capabilities will grow quickly over time. This sector will continue to push for more state-of-the-art knowledge and state-of-the-art technology never attempted before to develop innovative approaches for improving life sciences research in space. It is also a high-risk, high-reward sector, where projects tend to be expensive to fund and maintain but have the potential to unlock discoveries essential for humans to become a multi-planetary species. Through joint collaborations and partnerships and by building on previous milestones, resources, and tools that have been established for spaceflight, we can continue to rapidly advance our in-flight genomics capabilities.
PARÁGRAFO: Results that emerge from scRNA-seq and SRT experiments conducted in spaceflight are expected to increase our understanding of life in space, genetic control of fundamental processes that are altered by spaceflight, and genomic control mechanisms in cellular biology. Research groups and scientists in the field of space biosciences will continue to generate robust multi-omic profiles of both in vitro and in vivo biospecimens available from previous missions and biospecimen samples returned from future missions. The quality of these data will increase as better preservation protocols and innovative orbital lab solutions are implemented. The results will allow us to pinpoint cell-type-specific and locational disturbances in gene expression and will facilitate the development of countermeasures against spaceflight-associated dysregulation and disease. This goal is also in line with current international collaborative efforts to expand our presence in LEO (low Earth orbit), return to the moon, and progress forward to Mars.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The advent of civilian spaceflight challenges scientists to precisely describe the effects of spaceflight on human physiology, particularly at the molecular and cellular level. Newer, nanopore-based sequencing technologies can quantitatively map changes in chemical structure and expression at single molecule resolution across entire isoforms. We perform long-read, direct RNA nanopore sequencing, as well as Ultima high-coverage RNA-sequencing, of whole blood sampled longitudinally from four SpaceX Inspiration4 astronauts at seven timepoints, spanning pre-flight, day of return, and post-flight recovery. We report key genetic pathways, including changes in erythrocyte regulation, stress induction, and immune changes affected by spaceflight. We also present the first m6A methylation profiles for a human space mission, suggesting a significant spike in m6A levels immediately post-flight. These data and results represent the first longitudinal long-read RNA profiles and RNA modification maps for each gene for astronauts, improving our understanding of the human transcriptome’s dynamic response to spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of spaceflight on the human body. Biospecimen samples were collected from four crew members longitudinally before (Launch: L-92, L-44, L-3 days), during (Flight Day: FD1, FD2, FD3), and after (Return: R + 1, R + 45, R + 82, R + 194 days) spaceflight, spanning a total of 289 days across 2021-2022. The collection process included venous whole blood, capillary dried blood spot cards, saliva, urine, stool, body swabs, capsule swabs, SpaceX Dragon capsule HEPA filter, and skin biopsies. Venous whole blood was further processed to obtain aliquots of serum, plasma, extracellular vesicles and particles, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In total, 2,911 sample aliquots were shipped to our central lab at Weill Cornell Medicine for downstream assays and biobanking. This paper provides an overview of the extensive biospecimen collection and highlights their processing procedures and long-term biobanking techniques, facilitating future molecular tests and evaluations.As such, this study details a robust framework for obtaining and preserving high-quality human, microbial, and environmental samples for aerospace medicine in the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative, which can aid future human spaceflight and space biology experiments.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The discovery of new drugs is often propelled by the increasing resistance of parasites to existing drugs and the availability of better technology platforms. The area of microfluidics has provided devices for faster screening of compounds, controlled sampling/sorting of whole animals, and automated behavioral pattern recognition. In most microfluidic devices, drug effects on small animals (e.g., Caenorhabditis elegans) are quantified by an end-point, dose response curve representing a single parameter (such as worm velocity or stroke frequency). Here, we present a multi-parameter extraction method to characterize modes of paralysis in C. elegans over an extended time period. A microfluidic device with real-time imaging is used to expose C. elegans to four anthelmintic drugs (i.e., pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine). We quantified worm behavior with parameters such as curls per second, types of paralyzation, mode frequency, and number/duration of active/immobilization periods. Each drug was chosen at EC75 where 75% of the worm population is responsive to the drug. At equipotent concentrations, we observed differences in the manner with which worms paralyzed in drug environments. Our study highlights the need for assaying drug effects on small animal models with multiple parameters quantified at regular time points over an extended period to adequately capture the resistance and adaptability in chemical environments.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Environmental toxicants influence development, behavior, and ultimately survival. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be an exceptionally powerful model for toxicological studies. Here, we develop novel technologies to describe the effects of cyanide toxicity with high spatiotemporal resolution. Importantly, we use these methods to examine the genetic underpinnings of cyanide resistance. Caenorhabditis elegans that lack the EGL-9 oxygen sensing enzyme have been shown to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN) gas produced by the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that the cyanide resistance exhibited by egl-9 mutants is completely dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely functions in metabolic pathways that inactivate cyanide. Further, the expression of cysl-2 correlates with the degree of cyanide resistance exhibited in each genetic background. We find that each mutant exhibits similar relative resistance to HCN gas on plates or to aqueous potassium cyanide in microfluidic chambers. The design of the microfluidic devices, in combination with real-time imaging, addresses a series of challenges presented by mutant phenotypes and by the chemical nature of the toxicant. The microfluidic assay produces a set of behavioral parameters with increased resolution that describe cyanide toxicity and resistance in C. elegans, and this is particularly useful in analyzing subtle phenotypes. These multiparameter analyses of C. elegans behavior hold great potential as a means to monitor the effects of toxicants or chemical interventions in real time and to study the biological networks that underpin toxicant resistance.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The 14-3-3 proteins specifically bind a number of client proteins to influence important pathways, including flowering timing via the photosensory system. For instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 μ T-DNA insertion mutant, 14-3-3μ-1, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 ν T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and co mutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth, 14-3-3μ-1 roots did not increase in greening as much as wild-type roots. This study reveals new developmental roles of 14-3-3 proteins in roots and chloroplasts, probably via association with the photosensory system.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The 14-3-3 proteins have emerged as major phosphoprotein interaction proteins and thereby constitute a key node in the Arabidopsis Interactome Map, a node through which a large number of important signals pass. Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: The initial characterization of the Aspergillus niger isolate JSC-093350089, collected from U.S. segment surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the extensively studied strain ATCC 1015. Whole-genome sequencing of the ISS isolate enabled its phylogenetic placement within the A. niger/welwitschiae/lacticoffeatus clade and revealed that the genome of JSC-093350089 is within the observed genetic variance of other sequenced A. niger strains. The ISS isolate exhibited an increased rate of growth and pigment distribution compared to a terrestrial strain. Analysis of the isolate’s proteome revealed significant differences in the molecular phenotype of JSC-093350089, including increased abundance of proteins involved in the A. niger starvation response, oxidative stress resistance, cell wall modulation, and nutrient acquisition. Together, these data reveal the existence of a distinct strain of A. niger on board the ISS and provide insight into the characteristics of melanized fungal species inhabiting spacecraft environments.
PARÁGRAFO: IMPORTANCE A thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered during spaceflight presents many economic benefits and is imperative for the health of crew. As A. niger is a predominant ISS isolate frequently detected in built environments, studies of A. niger strains inhabiting closed systems may reveal information fundamental to the success of long-duration space missions. This investigation provides valuable insights into the adaptive mechanisms of fungi in extreme environments as well as countermeasures to eradicate unfavorable microbes. Further, it enhances understanding of host-microbe interactions in closed systems, which can help NASA’s Human Research Program maintain a habitat healthy for crew during long-term manned space missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Plants have been recognized as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for space exploration, and many experiments have been carried out to evaluate their adaptability to spaceflight. Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew Brachypodium distachyon seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ’s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the “Oxidative Stress Response” GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the “Plant Hormonal Signaling” and “MAP Kinase Signaling” KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that Brachypodium distachyon seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: • Premise of the study: In spaceflight experiments, tissues for morphologic study are fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, while tissues for molecular study are fixed in RNAlater; thus, an experiment containing both study components requires multiple fixation strategies. The possibility of using RNAlater-fixed materials for standard SEM-based morphometric investigation was explored to expand the library of tissues available for analysis and maximize usage of samples returned from spaceflight, but these technologies have wide application to any situation where recovery of biological resources is limited.
PARÁGRAFO: • Methods and Results: RNAlater-fixed samples were desalinated in distilled water, dehydrated through graded methanol, plunged into liquid ethane, and transferred to cryovials for freeze-substitution. Sample tissues were critical point dried, mounted, sputter-coated, and imaged.
PARÁGRAFO: • Conclusions: The protocol resulted in acceptable SEM images from RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis thaliana tissue. The majority of the tissues remained intact, including general morphology and finer details such as root hairs and trichomes.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation.
PARÁGRAFO: Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight. Key Words: ARG1—Spaceflight—Gene expression—Physiological adaptation—BRIC. Astrobiology 17, 1077–1111.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480, which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.

PARÁGRAFO: Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) is part of the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) network, and plays an essential role beyond heat shock in environmental stress responses and cellular homeostatic control. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells’ physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2-dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight. Collectively these data indicate a non-thermal role for the HSF network in spaceflight adaptation.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: A comprehensive understanding of spaceflight factors involved in immune dysfunction and the evaluation of biomarkers to assess in-flight astronaut health are essential goals for NASA. An elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a potential biomarker candidate, as leukocyte differentials are altered during spaceflight. In the reduced gravity environment of space, rodents and astronauts displayed elevated NLR and granulocyte-to-lymphocyte ratios (GLR), respectively. To simulate microgravity using two well-established ground-based models, we cultured human whole blood-leukocytes in high-aspect rotating wall vessels (HARV-RWV) and used hindlimb unloaded (HU) mice. Both HARV-RWV simulation of leukocytes and HU-exposed mice showed elevated NLR profiles comparable to spaceflight exposed samples. To assess mechanisms involved, we found the simulated microgravity HARV-RWV model resulted in an imbalance of redox processes and activation of myeloperoxidase-producing inflammatory neutrophils, while antioxidant treatment reversed these effects. In the simulated microgravity HU model, mitochondrial catalase-transgenic mice that have reduced oxidative stress responses showed reduced neutrophil counts, NLR, and a dampened release of selective inflammatory cytokines compared to wildtype HU mice, suggesting simulated microgravity induced oxidative stress responses that triggered inflammation. In brief, both spaceflight and simulated microgravity models caused elevated NLR, indicating this as a potential biomarker for future in-flight immune health monitoring.

PARÁGRAFO: Using a ground-based model to simulate spaceflight [21-days of single-housed, hindlimb unloading (HLU) combined with continuous low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR, total dose of 0.04 Gy)], an in-depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7-days post-exposure was performed. Collected blood was profiled with a hematology analyzer and spleens were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). The results revealed negligible differences in immune differentials. However, hematological system analyses of whole blood indicated large disparities in red blood cell differentials and morphology, suggestive of anemia. Murine Reactome networks indicated majority of spleen cells displayed differentially expressed genes (DEG) involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Although immune differentials were not changed, DEG analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function persist to 1-week post-simulated spaceflight. Additionally, specific regulation pathways associated with human blood disease gene orthologs, such as blood pressure regulation, transforming growth factor-β receptor signaling, and B cell differentiation were noted. Collectively, this study revealed differential immune and hematological outcomes 1-week post-simulated spaceflight conditions, suggesting recovery from spaceflight is an unremitting process.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Background: Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight show transcriptomic changes that resemble aspects of several terrestrial abiotic stress responses. Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)] along with a wild-type Col-0 control.
PARÁGRAFO: Results: The elp2-5 plants suffered in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight in that their roots failed to extend away from the seed and the overall development of the plants was greatly impaired in space. The met1-7 plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5. Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5.
PARÁGRAFO: Conclusion: Arabidopsis physiological adaptation to spaceflight results in differential DNA methylation in an organ-specific manner. Disruption of Met1 methyltransferase function does not dramatically affect spaceflight growth or morphology, yet met1-7 reprograms the spaceflight transcriptomic response in a unique manner. Disruption of elp2-5 results in poor development in spaceflight grown plants, together with a diminished, dramatically reprogrammed transcriptomic response.

PARÁGRAFO: The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in-situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop and many showed severe stress morphologies. Moreover, all plants grown in lunar soils differentially expressed genes indicating ionic stresses, similar to plant reactions to salt, metal and reactive oxygen species. Therefore, although in situ lunar regoliths can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to best enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support within lunar stations.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight poses risks to the central nervous system (CNS), and understanding neurological responses is important for future missions. We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to microgravity (SFμg) and artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFμg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFμg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFμg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.
PARÁGRAFO: Exploration missions to the Moon and Mars would expose astronauts to environmental challenges, including gravitational changes, ionizing radiation, altered circadian rhythm, elevated CO2, and isolation. Human acclimation to these environments presents complex health effects, with acute and prolonged consequences in multiple tissues that may result in increased risk to crew health and performance during the mission (Afshinnekoo et al., 2020; Crucian et al., 2015; Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019; Grimm et al., 2016; Indo et al., 2016; Kononikhin et al., 2017; Wilson et al., 2018). With a high concentration of oxidizable, unsaturated lipids, low levels of antioxidant defenses, and high energy demand, the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to space stressors, with studies reporting behavioral deficits in spatial orientation, coordination, and locomotion, as well as cognition (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Clément et al., 2020, Salim, 2017, Friedman, 2011).
PARÁGRAFO: Spanning over 60 years of research, the short-term impacts of spaceflight on the CNS have been investigated, but there is still insufficient data regarding its long-term health risks (Clément et al., 2020). Also, there are limitations to evaluating the impact of CNS damage in humans. Therefore, there is a need to leverage research approaches using animal models that would aid in cellular, molecular, and mechanistic understanding of CNS responses to spaceflight. Recent literature has established the fruit fly as a valuable model for understanding the effects of microgravity (μg), hypergravity, and radiation in the spaceflight environment (Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Ikenaga et al., 1997; Marcu et al., 2011; Ogneva et al., 2016). With their small size, short generation time (~10 days), short lifespan (~60-80 days), large number of offspring, and low cost of rearing, flies mitigate many of the practical concerns stemming from performing long term, multigenerational studies in space.
PARÁGRAFO: Here, we present the results of an International Space Station (ISS)-based study, MVPFly-01(Multi-use Variable-gravity Platform), to understand the effects of spaceflight on the fly nervous system and the value of artificial gravity (AG) as a countermeasure. AG is an attractive countermeasure, since it can potentially ameliorate the effect of microgravity (μg) on multiple physiological systems, by simulating Earth-like gravity (Clément, 2017; Clément and Traon, 2004; Horie et al., 2019; Shiba et al., 2017; Young, 1999). We performed behavioral analyses, brain immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and transcriptomics on flies subjected to microgravity (SFμg), inflight artificially simulated Earth gravity (SF1g), and environmentally matched ground control (Earth). Our results showed inflight and postflight behavioral changes and morphological alterations in the brain immediately postflight in response to μg. Further, acclimation to Earth following spaceflight revealed brain morphological changes in both SF1g and SFμg flies, with pronounced phenotypes in SFμg. These results, in combination with metabolic pathways altered in transcriptomic and proteomic studies on fly heads frozen on the ISS provide comprehensive information on the effects of inflight AG exposure on CNS and postflight acclimation to Earth conditions.
PARÁGRAFO: The ISS is a useful environment for studying the effects of spaceflight by combining a μg environment with ionizing radiation and CO2 levels that are elevated compared to Earth’s surface (McDonald et al., 2020). The MVP-Fly-01 validation mission (34 days) has enabled comprehensive investigations of the fly CNS (Figure 1A). The two inflight centrifuges in the MVP hardware allowed us to maintain one centrifuge at μg (SFμg) with the flies developing entirely in μg, while the other centrifuge simulated Earth’s gravitational force (SF1g) on ISS and acted as a high-fidelity on-orbit control for gravity. In other words, the spaceflown flies experienced identical environmental perturbations during take-off and landing, were maintained in identical hardware, similar gas composition, sound pressure levels, temperature, and radiation environments in space, but were reared either under a 1g force in space or in μg. Upon completing the mission, a postflight ground control experiment was performed on Earth (Earth) using the same flight hardware and precisely simulating spaceflight conditions. The flies retrieved upon completion of the mission were used for behavioral, morphological, and acclimation analyses to study the effects of spaceflight on the CNS (Figure 1B).
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Schematic of MVP-Fly01 mission outline depicting the 34-days mission on ISS. Camera represents inflight videos that were recorded to monitor fly health and behavior. Onboard operations included freezing the food cylinders containing flies and larvae in RNAlater for omics analysis. Live flies were returned to Earth. Following the telemetry and timeline of the mission, matched Earth controls were performed (Earth). (B) Experimental timeline highlighting the onboard operations and postflight R+0 and R+25 assays. (C) Computation of fly activity by MIP. i) The first frame from one video recorded during the mission. ii) The negative of the blue channel in grayscale of the first frame with two flies circled in green and red. iii) The MIP image captures the movement (blue and red arrows) and no movement (green) of the flies. iv) Final MIP projection used in the algorithm. The white tracks represent flies that moved at any point during the recording. (D) Fly activity mapped overtime for 16 days (mission day 13-28). Each row represents one adult fly chamber in an individual MVP module, and across from left to right is a temporal progression with every six rectangles (each rectangle = 28s video recording) spanning a single 12-hr light period. The color bar represents the activity level from a minimum background intensity (dark blue) to the highest activity level intensity (bright green). Top six rows correspond to SF1g flies and bottom five to SFμg flies. (E) Line graphs show increased activity levels across mission day 13-28 averaged over each day across modules for each population set (n=5-73). *p<0.05.
PARÁGRAFO: We developed an automated quantification algorithm that computes the maximum intensity projections (MIPs) of video recordings of fly behavior (represented in Videos S1 and S2) during spaceflight and sums pixel intensities to produce numerical values representative of fly activity levels (higher numerical values correlate with high fly activity), accounting for both the emergence of flies and their movement during the 12-hr light period (Figure 1C). Since the fly population sizes in adult fly chamber 1 were not statistically different between SF1g and SFμg (Figure S2), any difference in MIP intensity between these two groups reflected differences in fly activity. We generated a color map showing the relative numerical activity in adult fly chamber 1 as a function of mission timeline (days 13-28) for each module grouped as either SF1g or SFμg (Figure 1D). Upon quantification, we found that the overall activity level of the SF1g flies is significantly below SFμg flies (Figure 1E). On mission day 20 and 28, there is no distinguishable difference in the activity for the two gravity levels. This is possibly due to the initial emergence of flies into the adult fly chamber around day 20 that causes a similar increase in activity in both SF1g and SFμg environments. On day 28, the high density of flies in both conditions may result in close proximity of the flies, thereby increasing their activity levels. The results show that within the closely matched fly populations maintained in spaceflight, flies exposed to μg conditions show significantly greater levels of activity than their 1g counterparts.
PARÁGRAFO: Upon landing, a subset of F1 flies were first used for behavioral assays to measure climbing ability. Climbing ability is the fly’s innate negative geotactic response and is routinely used to assess nervous system dysfunction in fly models (Chakraborty et al., 2011; Iijima et al., 2004). This behavior relies on the integrity of the connection between the brain and muscles. Specifically, it involves the mushroom body, which is the part of the brain that regulates the transition from rest to responsiveness in relation to environmental stressors (Martin et al., 1998). To capture the sexually dimorphic responses, we assessed males and females separately in our analysis. We observed that males born in μg were more affected with significant deficits in climbing ability compared to Earth males (Figure 2A). A decreasing trend was also observed in SFμg females and SF1g (males and females) compared to their respective Earth control. Additionally, we noted a significant decrease in climbing ability in SFμg males compared to SFμg females. This result is consistent with the previously observed reduction in postflight climbing response in males exposed to μg (Benguría et al., 1996).
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Decreased climbing ability of space-flown flies (n=90-120). (B) Representative image of fly brain stained with neuronal marker, anti-ELAV; neuronal cortex marked by the dashed outer white line and neuropil marked by the dashed inner yellow line. Quantification shows decrease in neuronal cortex area (C) and neuropil area (D) in SFμg compared to both Earth and SF1g controls (n=10-14). (E) Representative images of fly brains labeled with anti-TH (green), anti-REPO (red), anti-CC3 (white), and anti-8-oxo-dG (cyan). Quantification showed significant loss in DA neurons (F) (n=6-9) and alterations in glial numbers (G) (n=5-9), apoptosis (H) (n=5-7), and oxidative DNA damage (I) (n=5-7) in SFμg condition. Two-way ANOVA results are displayed above the histogram. Significance calculated by post-hoc test is represented as *p<0.05; **p<0.01; *** p<0.001.
PARÁGRAFO: We then dissected the adult fly brains and stained them with neuronal (anti-ELAV) (Figure 2B), apoptotic (anti-CC3), and oxidative stress-associated DNA damage (anti-8-oxo-dG) (Figure 2E) markers. Upon quantification, we observed a slight yet significant reduction in the total brain area of SFμg female flies compared to both Earth and SF1g females; males showed no change in brain sizes (Figure S3A). Morphological quantification with anti-ELAV staining showed a significant decrease in neuronal cortex area (Figure 2B, C, and S3B) in SFμg flies compared to Earth and SF1g control flies in both sexes. Similarly, the neuropil area is significantly reduced in SFμg compared to Earth flies (Figure 2D). A similar phenotype was noted in the Alzheimer’s disease fly model accompanied with behavioral deficits (Mhatre et al., 2014). No significant differences in neuronal cortex and neuropil areas were observed in SF1g compared to Earth flies (Figure 2C, D). A marked increase in CC3 positive apoptotic puncta (Figure 2E, H) and 8-oxo-dG positive cells (Figure 2E, I) was observed in flies subjected to SFμg as compared to Earth and SF1g controls. Apoptotic cells were detected throughout the brain, and many of them colocalized with the ELAV marker (Figure S3Cv). Additionally, all the 8-oxo-dG positive cells colocalize with neuronal ELAV marker, suggesting oxidative damage in neuronal cells (Figure S3Civ, marked with green arrowhead). The observed oxidative stress response has been documented in previous spaceflight and ground-based altered gravity studies in mice and flies (Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Mao et al., 2016, 2018b, 2020; da Silveira et al., 2020).
PARÁGRAFO: Another subset of brains was stained with glial (anti-Repo), and dopaminergic neuron (anti-TH) (Figure 2E) markers. Gross analysis of the total number of dopaminergic (DA) neurons revealed a reduction in DA neuron count in SFμg compared to SF1g and Earth fly brains in both sexes (Figure 2E, F). Like the climbing behavior, we observed significantly lowered DA neurons in SFμg males compared to SFμg females suggesting sensitivity of male flies to μg. DA neurons are involved in locomotion, and the lack of these neurons have been identified in the development of Parkinson’s disease in humans (Ryczko and Dubuc, 2017). We also observed a significant increase in DA neurons in SF1g males compared to the Earth males; this may be part of a phenotype resulting from exposure to a 1g centrifugal force on flies that are also perturbed by a combination of spaceflight stressors - ionizing radiation and elevated CO2 levels. In the case of glia, SFμg females and SF1g (both males and females) displayed an increasing trend in glial cell number compared to Earth controls. However, the SFμg males showed a decreasing trend in the glial population compared to Earth males (Figure 2E, G), and a significant reduction in the glial population compared to SF1g males. Further experiments are necessary to study the sex specificity of the spaceflight effects and the underlying mechanisms contributing to these differences in glial cell populations.
PARÁGRAFO: The SF1g and Earth flies were exposed to similar temperature, humidity, CO2, and sound pressure levels, however, ionizing radiation was an additional spaceflight stressor experienced by the SF1g flies compared to the Earth flies. Thus, the similarity in morphological phenotype between SF1g and Earth control flies in many of the readouts analyzed here, including behavior, neuronal cortex and neuropil areas, apoptosis, and oxidative damage (Figure 2), suggests that radiation alone may not be a significant contributing factor for the immediate postflight CNS effects of spaceflight. However, ionizing radiation may contribute to some of the long-term effects of spaceflight on the CNS and are discussed further in a later section. The entire experiment occurred over a short duration (34 days) and the radiation environment in LEO is known to be more benign than the environment in deep space, beyond the Van Allen belts (Nelson, 2016). Therefore, the gross physiological changes induced in LEO flights like on ISS, as observed in SFμg flies, at least for the CNS immediately post-return, may primarily be associated with changes in gravity. Thus, these results indicate that gravity can play a key role in the LEO environment, causing neuronal and neurobehavioral deficits during spaceflight.
PARÁGRAFO: Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed on the heads of flies which developed entirely on ISS under SFμg or SF1g conditions and Earth controls (Figure 3A). RNAseq on heads from SFμg flies compared with Earth controls showed differential expression of 1014 genes in females and 507 genes in males, while proteomics analysis revealed differential expression of 577 proteins in females and 719 proteins in males. RNAseq in SF1g flies compared to Earth reared flies showed differential expression of 80 genes in females and 601 genes in males, and proteomics analysis revealed differential expression of 389 proteins in females and 425 proteins in males (Figure 3A). Overall, these results suggest alterations in transcripts and protein levels when flies are reared in space conditions compared to Earth condition. A full list of DEGs and DEPs is provided in Supplementary data (.xls 1 and 2). Further, to understand the overlap across the transcriptomics and proteomics as well as across the different experimental conditions, we generated an UpSet diagram displaying top 30 intersections (Figure 3B). The overlap between the DEGs (orange dots and bars) and DEPs (green dots and bars) for the experimental conditions is shown, and across DEGs and DEPs are marked in black. Also shown are the genes and proteins unique to each condition (grey dots and bars). The intersection within DEPs across experimental conditions yields more hits compared to DEGs. This is evidenced by 167 significantly altered proteins (adj. p-value < 0.05), compared to 25 significantly altered genes (adj. p-value<0.05) in SF1g and SFμg conditions compared to Earth controls (Figures 3B and S4A, B). The observed overlapping DEPs and DEGs are potential spaceflight signatures irrespective of gravity that can be further investigated. Additionally, though we observe minimal overlap across both transcriptomic and proteomic platform, the common processes possibly share a transcriptional mechanism of dysregulation, hence making these processes central towards the phenotype manifested in spaceflight flies. For example, as shown in the case of SFμg female compared to Earth female, the gene ontology (GO) analysis of overlapping DEPs and DEGs (65) revealed enrichment of key biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF) that closely regulate mitochondrial functions, metabolic processes, immune response, and synaptic signaling, among others (Figure S4C).
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Schematic showing transcriptomics and proteomics sample processing. Table provides a global view of the total number of differentially up and down regulated genes (DEGs) and proteins (DEPs) in SF1g and SFμg compared to Earth control. (B) Upset plot displays top 30 intersections across omics platforms and between conditions (SF1g males, SF1g females, SFμg males, SFμg females). The purple horizontal bars indicate the total number of DEGs and DEPs identified in each condition. The dotted region shows all conditions, connecting lines with black nodes show overlap across omics platforms (DEGs and DEPs), whereas orange nodes show overlap across different conditions in DEGs and green nodes show overlap across different conditions in DEPs. Grey nodes represent the DEGs and DEPs unique to a condition. The vertical bars indicate the number of unique or overlapping genes/proteins. (C) Dot plot representing top 20 significantly (adj.p-value <0.05) enriched gene ontology (GO) terms in biological processes in SF1g and SFμg compared to Earth control. SF1g female RNA compared to Earth control did not have any enriched GO biological processes, hence not represented in the dot plot. The color of the dot represents adj. p-value, and the size represents gene ratio.
PARÁGRAFO: The spaceflight conditions (SF1g and SFμg) compared to Earth were analyzed across the omics platforms. Figure 3C highlights the top 20 significantly enriched GO biological processes, including cuticle development, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain, metabolic processes, response to heat, protein folding, neurotransmitter secretion, synaptic vesicle signaling, and retinal homeostasis, among others. The enrichment is more evident in proteins compared to RNA. The complete list from GO enrichment analysis (BP, CC, MF) is provided in Supplementary.xls 1 and 2. Further, we note a sexually dimorphic response in the transcriptomic dataset, which is not observed in proteomics analysis (Figure S5).
PARÁGRAFO: KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on the proteomics dataset across conditions revealed sexual dimorphism at the pathway enrichment level (more KEGG pathway enrichment in females than males), which was more evident in SF1g than SFμg condition. Proteomic data of SFμg flies (males and females) show enrichment of pathways such as endocytosis, cellular metabolic responsive pathways – tyrosine metabolism, sucrose metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, carbon metabolism, glutamate metabolism, glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4A). These metabolic pathways play critical roles in cellular as well as mitochondrial homeostasis. The metabolic reprogramming under spaceflight conditions suggests metabolic and cellular stress, similar to that observed in cancer and aging (Brooks Robey et al., 2015; Wallace, 2005). Similar regulation of metabolic pathways is observed in other spaceflight-based mammalian studies, including humans (GarrettBakelman et al., 2019b; de Luca et al., 2009; da Silveira et al., 2020; Stein, 2002). Analysis of cellular respiration revealed perturbations in the biological processes and cellular components encompassing every step of the pathway, i.e., glucose metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, citric acid cycle (TCA), and electron transport chain as well as at mitochondrial organelle level (Figure 4B, C). This is observed in both spaceflight conditions but is more pronounced in SFμg than SF1g (both sexes), suggesting differential regulation under the spaceflight stress ± gravity vector.

The size of the dot is based on the gene count enriched in the pathways, and the color of the dot represents pathway significance. (B, C) GO enrichment analysis. Dot plot showing GO terms (adj. p-value<0.05) associated with cellular respiration in biological processes (B), and cellular components (C) for SF1g and SFμg (DEPs) compared to Earth control. The color of the dot represents adj. p-value, and the size represents gene ratio. (D-F) Heatmap representation of differential expression (log2[fold-change]) of significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins (D), glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism proteins (E), and proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation (F) in SF1g and SFμg vs. Earth. (G) Differentially expressed proteins (in red) in SFμg females (vs. Earth females) are mapped onto the oxidative phosphorylation KEGG pathway using KEGG mapper. (H-I) Heatmap displays log2[fold-change] of proteins that are significantly expressed (adj. p-value<0.05) in fatty acid metabolism (H), and amino acid metabolism (I), with red representing upregulated and blue for downregulated.
PARÁGRAFO: At the mitochondrial level, an increase in PGAM5 and mitochondrial fission/fusion proteins such as dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and OPA1 were observed, suggesting increased mitochondrial dynamics (Figure 4D). We observed the upregulation of many enzymes involved in glycolysis, such as hexokinase C (HEXC) and Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP) (Figure 4E), suggesting increased glycolytic flux (Tanner et al., 2018). Meanwhile, we observed an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), suggesting funneling of glycolysis products towards lactate production under spaceflight conditions. Another key enzyme, AcCoAS, is downregulated, thereby reducing the production of Acetyl-CoA, a key enzyme required for the TCA cycle. Further, modulation of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation/ETC is noted (Figure 4F). While ETC proteins are differentially regulated under both SF1g and SFμg conditions, the number of proteins regulated under SFμg is more than the SF1g condition. In fact, differential regulation of at least one protein associated with each of the five ETC complexes is observed under SFμg conditions (Figure 4G), which may contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Moreover, KEGG pathway enrichment shows differential regulation of fatty acid metabolism as well as amino acid metabolism. We observed an upregulation of enzymes involved in fatty acid (Figure 4H) and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4I), suggesting high energy demand, thereby emphasizing cellular stress response under spaceflight conditions (SFμg> SF1g).
PARÁGRAFO: During spaceflight, metabolic pathways are altered along with the biological processes associated with cellular stress, including response to heat, response to ROS, ROS metabolic process, and cellular homeostasis, thus indicating increased cellular stress (Figure 5A). We see significant upregulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs): HSP70AB, HSP26, HSP23, HSP27, and HSP67BC in both spaceflight conditions (Figure 5B). HSPs are the molecular chaperones with cytoprotective properties that are induced in response to a variety of cellular insults such as heat, radiation, oxidative stress, and altered gravity, to confer protection against deteriorating effects of ROS (Bukau et al., 2006; Hateley et al., 2016; Hosamani et al., 2016; Ikwegbue et al., 2018). Low amounts of ROS aid in neuronal development and function, but oxidative stress-induced excessive ROS levels lead to cellular damage, increased blood-brain barrier permeability, and altered brain morphology, causing neuroinflammation and neuronal death (Gu, 2011). Our observations of increased neuronal loss, apoptosis and oxidative damage in the fly brain further confirm the effects of oxidative stress during spaceflight (Figure 2). These morphological defects in the brain correlate with the altered expression of proteins that are enriched in functions such as neuronal projection, neuron death, axonogenesis, and synaptic transmission in SFμg flies compared to Earth (Figure 5C).
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Dot plot showing enriched GO terms (adj. p-value<0.05) associated with cellular stress in biological processes and molecular function for SF1g and SFμg (DEPs) compared to Earth. (B) Heatmap representation of differential expression (log2[fold-change]) of significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) cellular stress response proteins. (C) Dot plot highlighting enriched GO terms (p<0.05) associated with neuronal and synaptic signaling in biological processes, molecular function, and cellular components across all conditions (DEPs). (D) Heatmap displays log2[fold-change of proteins that are significantly altered (adj. p-value<0.05) in synaptic transmission. For dot plot, the color of the dot represents adj. p-value, and the size represents gene ratio. For heatmap, the red color represents upregulated and blue shows downregulated proteins.
PARÁGRAFO: In terms of neuronal functioning, we observed modulations in proteins involved in synaptic transmission across all spaceflight conditions (Figure 5D). For instance, SNARE protein syntaxin 1A (SYX1A), syntaxin binding protein SNAP24, presynaptic calcium sensor synaptotagmin (SYT), presynaptic calcium signaling protein P32, endocytic fission protein dynamin (SHI), and endocytic coat protein clathrin heavy chain (CHC) are downregulated. Meanwhile, the vesicle-mediated transport protein GDI, NSF1 protein that aids in disassembly of SNARE complex (COMT), cell-cell adhesion mediator protein FAS2, vesicular trafficking protein ARF79F, and synapsin (SYN), a phosphoprotein associated with synaptic vesicles, among others are upregulated. These proteins collectively encompass almost every step of the synaptic vesicle cycle. The number of proteins altered is higher in SFμg condition than SF1g, and within SFμg condition, males show more changes than females, further reinforcing the selective sensitivity towards males and a dose-dependent response across spaceflight condition. Additionally, proteins associated with muscle and cytoskeleton are also noted in spaceflight flies (SFμg> SF1g) (Figure S5 C,D), consistent with previous spaceflight findings (Ogneva et al., 2016; Walls et al., 2020).
PARÁGRAFO: Proteomics analysis suggests enrichment of behavioral and aging markers in SF1g and SFμg flies (Figure S6A). Specifically, the upregulation of HSP26, HSP27, HSP68, MTPalpha, CAT, SM, and TRXR-1, LDH, and downregulation of DJ-1beta, MSRA, and LEVY is observed across all conditions (Figure S6B). These proteins are also associated with oxidative stress response, which has been shown to increase with age (Lavara-Culebras and Paricio, 2007; Liao et al., 2008; Long et al., 2020a; Ren et al., 2017). To further understand the effects of spaceflight as the flies acclimate to Earth’s gravity, we aged the flies for 25 days post-return under terrestrial conditions (R+25 days). Figure S7 shows the observed changes at R+25 timepoint for DA neuron counts, neuronal cortex area, apoptosis, and glial phenotypes. Overall, at the R+25 timepoint, the brain morphology of SF1g and SFμg is altered compared to Earth controls with sex-specific changes observed in the neuronal cortex area (Figure S7). We then performed the longitudinal comparison of morphological changes in fly brains between the R+0 (11-17 days old) and R+25 (36-42 days old) time points. This paradigm is similar to the post-mission evaluation of astronauts as they acclimate to Earth conditions over a period of time. Significant reduction of DA neurons was observed early in SFμg flies at the R+0 time point, compared to the gradual loss of these neurons in Earth and SF1g flies at the R+25 time point (Figure 6A). Typically, terrestrial conditions have not been associated with age-related loss of DA neurons (White et al., 2010), however, the elevated levels of CO2 in Earth flies (analogous to SF1g and SFμg) in this study may contribute to the observed loss of DA neurons as the flies age in the Earth controls. Further, comparison of neuronal cortex areas between R+0 and R+25 data showed no change in the Earth flies, while decreasing trend over time was noted in SF1g flies and a significant reduction in SFμg flies, thus suggesting increased neuronal loss with age in space reared flies (Figure 6B). This loss correlates with increased apoptosis observed in R+25 flies, both SF1g (39%) and SFμg (70%) compared to R+25 Earth flies (Figure 6C). This progressive increase in apoptosis in space-reared flies (R+25 Earth < R+25 SF1g <R+25 SFμg) may suggest a dose-dependent response in flies as we move from Earth to space conditions with exposure to multiple stressors, including increased ionizing radiation combined with exposure to reduced gravity.
PARÁGRAFO: (A-D) Stacked bar plots showing quantification of DA neurons (A) (n=5-10), neuronal cortex area (B) (n=10-14), apoptosis (C) (n=5-7), and glia (D) at R+0 and R+25 days. (E) Representative images of R+25 fly brains labeled with anti-REPO (red). Quantification of Repo positive cells at R+25 days showed total glial loss (D) and increase in the aggregates/rosettes (F) (white box in E inset) in SFμg, SF1g (n=6-9). Two-way ANOVA results are displayed above the stacked bar plots. Significance calculated by post-hoc test is represented as *p<0.05; **p<0.01; *** p<0.001.
PARÁGRAFO: Additionally, we assessed glia, the primary phagocytic cell in CNS that are required to clear oxidative stress-induced neuronal debris (Bilimoria and Stevens, 2015; Casano and Peri, 2015; Cronk and Kipnis, 2013; Cunningham, 2013; Freeman, 2006; Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007). At R+25, while we observe a slight but non-significant increase in glial cell numbers under Earth conditions (females: 7%, males: 17%), a significant depletion of the glial population in Earth acclimated SF1g (females: 56%, males: 59%), and sex-specific depletion in SFμg flies (females: 54%, males: 33%) is noted compared to their respective R+0 timepoint (Figure 6D, E). This depletion of the glial population can be due to burdening of the clearance system, eventually leading to glial apoptosis (Block et al., 2007), but additional investigation is warranted. Furthermore, as the flies age, we observe aggregates of glial cells that resemble rosettes (Figure 6E, inset). These rosettes were distinct in size and appearance from other glial cells and were not counted towards total repo-positive cell counts (Figure 6D); instead, they were counted separately (Figure 6F). This rosette phenotype is absent at the R+0 time point in all conditions, whereas it is observed at the R+25 time point specifically after exposure to spaceflight-related stressors in a dose-dependent manner (R+25 Earth < R+25 SF1g <R+25 SFμg) (Figure 6F). We believe the rosette to be a phenotype manifested as a long-term effect of the spaceflight environment. The rosette formation could result from factors such as elevated CO2 levels and can be exacerbated by the combinatorial effect of other spaceflight stressors such as ionizing radiation and reduced gravity.
PARÁGRAFO: While some of the immunohistochemical and omics results described here resemble early aging, more assays at additional time points need to be performed for further validation of the effect of spaceflight on related aging phenotypes. Although omics profiling at the R+25 time point would be informative and will be considered in future missions, these experiments were not feasible here since the flies were distributed for the other assays reported above. Taken together, the brain morphology at R+0 time point is similar in SF1g and Earth conditions, but as the flies age postflight under terrestrial conditions, the morphological deficits start manifesting in SF1g flies and are worsened over time in SFμg, suggesting a phenotype that is manifested after exposure to spaceflight.
PARÁGRAFO: Deep space exploration will expose space travelers to several environmental challenges, thereby altering the homeostatic equilibrium of various physiological systems, including the CNS. Understanding the risks to CNS and identifying countermeasures to mitigate these risks in astronauts will be crucial to ensure the success of missions to the Moon and Mars. Using MVP, a fruit fly space habitat, we provide insights into spaceflight effects on the brain at the molecular, morphological, and behavioral levels. While AG by rotation of the spacecraft is being considered as a potential countermeasure to μg, there is a gap in our understanding of AG prescriptions required to ameliorate the health concerns during spaceflight (Clément, 2017; Clément and Traon, 2004; Mao et al., 2018a; Young, 1999). To address this knowledge gap, we utilized the MVP hardware featuring an inflight centrifuge that simulates Earth’s gravity on the ISS (SF1g). SF1g served two objectives: 1) assessment of the use of AG as a countermeasure; and 2) distinguishing the effects of μg from other spaceflight stressors, such as radiation.
PARÁGRAFO: A key feature of the MVP hardware, the inflight video recording capability, aided in assessing the health of the flies during the mission and provided real-time data of behavioral alterations caused by the change in the gravitational environment. Due to the large number of videos taken on the mission, manual analysis by visual assessment was not feasible, nor was the use of specialized equipment traditionally used to assess fly behavior in ground laboratories (Chan et al., 2012; Inan et al., 2009, 2011; Kohlhoff et al., 2011; Slawson et al., 2009). Also, the constraints in video quality, such as uneven light distribution, inability to focus on flies in the foreground and the background, prevented the use of sophisticated tracking and machine learning algorithms for behavioral analysis. Therefore, a simple yet effective automated method was developed to quantitatively capture overall behavioral differences across spaceflight conditions. The overall level of activity of a population is a trait influenced by the environment and can be used to assess other physiological changes. Miller et al. suggested that fly hyperactivity in μg is a result of their innate negative geotactic response (Miller et al., 2002). Interestingly, our findings follow a similar trend, apart from the population flux point (day 20), we consistently observed that flies in SFμg are more active than those in SF1g (Figure 1D, E). This data suggests that AG may suppress the hyperactive behavior in flies during spaceflight.
PARÁGRAFO: Similar increases in fly activity (Benguría et al., 1996) and mouse circling behavior (Ronca et al., 2019) in spaceflight conditions have been reported. Future improvements in the flight hardware might aid in quantifying individual fly activity, thus providing further insights into behavioral changes caused by gravity changes and the ability to test the effectiveness of countermeasures.
PARÁGRAFO: A substantial fraction of the literature on the CNS effects of spaceflight focuses on either anatomical changes or molecular changes using omics platforms. In this study, we took a multimodal approach combining the morphological analysis with the omics-based molecular phenotyping for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with spaceflight-induced brain changes. At the transcriptomics level, we observed a higher number of differentially regulated genes in SFμg compared to Earth, specifically in females. Meanwhile, the SF1g females show fewer changes in RNA compared to Earth (Figure 3). Interestingly, at the proteomic level, the number of DEPs is relatively similar and show considerable overlap across spaceflight conditions (SF1g vs Earth and SFμg vs Earth). In many studies a discordance is observed between the two omics platforms; nevertheless, each data set offers unique insights into spaceflight-associated changes (Casas-Vila et al., 2017; De Sousa Abreu et al., 2009). While transcriptomic analyses provide broad-scale insights into molecular dynamics that occur on the level of mRNA regulation, most physiological processes are driven by protein function. Based on proteomics one important theme that was captured across both spaceflight conditions was a change in metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (Figures 3–5). These are consistent with previously published data on space-flown human kidney cells (Hammond et al., 2000) and mouse brain subjected to spaceflight (Mao et al., 2018b).
PARÁGRAFO: The brain is a metabolically dynamic and high-energy-demanding organ that is dependent on mitochondria for deriving energy via various metabolic processes that converge at glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Hall et al., 2012; Magistretti and Allaman, 2015). Normal functioning of the brain requires a tight temporal and spatial regulation of metabolite supply for energy production (Roy and Sherrington, 1890; Watts et al., 2018). We observe such metabolic regulation in spaceflight flies with increased glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism (Figure 4E, H, I). Additionally, spaceflight flies exhibit alteration in proteins of the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP metabolism (Figure 4F, G), similar to the observations in mice, astronauts, and the NASA Twins Study (da Silveira et al., 2020). Such dysregulation of ETC and abnormal mitochondrial dynamics (Figure 4D) can lead to mitochondrial and oxidative stress via ROS production (Bhatti et al., 2017). Oxidative stress during spaceflight is further evidenced by an increase in 8-oxo-dG, cellular oxidative stress marker, in the SFμg fly brain at R+0 time point (Figure 2E, I), and is consistent with the increase of 8-oxo-dG in urine and plasma samples in astronauts (Rai et al., 2011; da Silveira et al., 2020). On the contrary, SF1g brains at the R+0 time point showed no significant change in the 8-oxo-dG marker, thus suggesting that AG can suppress oxidative damage in the brain immediately after return from spaceflight (Figure 2E, I).
PARÁGRAFO: We hypothesize that the observed alterations in the metabolic pathways are an effort to restore cellular homeostasis via metabolic reprogramming. While homeostasis is restored in R+0 SF1g, possibly due to AG, as evidenced by their similar brain morphology to Earth flies (Figure 2), microgravity in SFμg acts as an additional stressor, potentially resulting in elevated oxidative stress. This stress can further trigger a cascade of events leading to neuronal damage as noted in the behavioral deficits (Figure 2A), loss of DA neurons (Figure 2E, F), decreased neuronal cortex and neuropil areas (Figure 2B–D and Figure S3B), and increased apoptosis (Figure 2E, H) in SFμg flies. Additionally, we observe perturbations in synaptic transmission proteins during spaceflight (Figure 5C, D), which in combination with bioenergetic changes (Figure 4) can result in dysregulation of calcium homeostasis and synaptic degeneration (Mattson and Liu, 2002). Synaptic changes have also been documented in multiple spaceflight and ground-based rodent studies (Bondar, 2005; DeFelipe et al., 2002; Gaofei et al., 2009; Howe et al., 2019; Machida et al., 2010; Mao et al., 2018; Parihar et al., 2015, 2016; Ranjan et al., 2014; Ross and Varelas, 2005; Sokolova et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). Neuronal damage and loss induced by elevated oxidative stress can potentially alter the glial response, initiating phagocytosis to clear neuronal debris (Block et al., 2007). While our observations of glial numbers immediately after return (R+0) shows an increasing trend in SFμg females and SF1g (females and males) (Figure 2G), further analysis is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism of change in glial function. Collectively, our observations suggest that brain morphological changes due to spaceflightinduced oxidative stress are more pronounced in μg conditions, and AG can provide partial protection to these phenotypes.
PARÁGRAFO: Based on our omics data, R+0 morphology, and the radiation levels on ISS, gravity seems to have a significant impact on the immediate phenotypes of spaceflight with larger observable changes in SFμg compared to SF1g. The environment experienced by the flies in SFμg compared to SF1g allows the comparison of gravity separately from the combined effect of the other spaceflight stressors like radiation, elevated CO2, and sound pressure which would equally impact both SF1g and SFμg. Although the morphological manifestations are not observed in SF1g flies at R+0 time point, with age (R+25), the phenotypes progressively present themselves in the form of increased apoptosis, neuronal loss, glial loss and aggregate formation (Figure 6AF). Glial loss may be attributed to the relocation of glia to the neuronal debris, thus resulting in aggregates (formation of rosettes), a phenotype specific to the spaceflight environment. These phenotypes in SF1g at R+25 may be a delayed response to radiation combined with exposure to other space stressors such as elevated CO2. Radiation studies in ground-based rodent models indicate that exposure to deep space radiation (galactic cosmic radiation or GCR) alone can affect behavior (Dutta et al., 2018; Euston et al., 2012; Parihar et al., 2015, 2018; Raber et al., 2018b), and neuronal phenotypes (Davis et al., 2015; Howe et al., 2019; Impey et al., 2016; Krukowski et al., 2018; Parihar et al., 2015, 2016; Raber et al., 2016, 2018b, 2019; Rabin et al., 2014; Whoolery et al., 2017). In an enclosed and isolated environment of the ISS, astronauts experience elevated CO2 levels that are considerably higher than ambient levels on Earth (Mahadevan et al., 2021). In our study, the Earth control flies were exposed to an environment mimicking ISS and experienced high CO2 levels similar to SF1g and SFμg flies, in contrast to regular lab conditions. Mild chronic hypercapnia due to constant exposure of elevated CO2 levels may contribute to the observed deficits of decreased TH positive cells, and repo positive rosettes (<10) in the Earth control flies at R+25, along with the increased cell death (CC3 positive cells) and DNA oxidation (8-oxo-dG positive cells) as noted at R+0 in Earth controls. In fact, in our ground-based study, we observed minimal cell death and DNA oxidation under normal terrestrial CO2 levels compared to Earth control brains from the MVP mission exposed to elevated CO2 levels (data not shown). Thus, the observations reported in the Earth controls are part of the unique spaceflight paradigm and may not be comparable to controls in terrestrial studies. While ground studies are important in separating the effects of individual space stressors, spaceflight studies are particularly relevant as we prepare for long-duration human missions to the Moon and Mars where there will be a combination of exposures to reduced gravity and doses of ionizing radiation that will be higher than in LEO (Mao et al., 2017; Straume et al., 2017).
PARÁGRAFO: This study integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, morphological, and behavioral analyses to investigate the effects of spaceflight on Drosophila CNS both during and after return from spaceflight. Further, our study utilizes inflight centrifuge mimicking Earth 1g, as a control that allowed us to separate μg from the effects of other spaceflight environmental factors such as ionizing radiation. Additionally, the postflight acclimation to Earth’s conditions is relevant to understanding the sustained effects of spaceflight on the CNS. Our integrated approach suggests that oxidative stress during spaceflight leads to differential regulation of metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and synaptic transmission resulting in neuronal deficits, glial changes, increased apoptosis, and behavioral impairments in Drosophila. Furthermore, this study indicates that μg is an important but not an exclusive environmental factor contributing to the neurobehavioral outcomes during long-term deep space missions. AG may provide a measure for short-term protection, but long-term solutions still need to be explored, especially for longduration missions in deep space. Earth’s magnetosphere partially protects against ionizing radiation from GCRs and solar particle events (SPE) in LEO, but beyond LEO, deep space irradiation will pose significant risks to crewmember health. Thus, along with AG, future countermeasure studies should target these pathways in model organisms that are amenable to large-scale screening in space.
PARÁGRAFO: The opportunity to conduct spaceflight experiments is not only rare and expensive, but the logistical constraints of such studies also make them highly challenging to perform (Inokuchi et al., 2007; Rutter et al., 2020). For instance, the experiment launch and retrieval can be significantly altered due to weather or technical issues with the spacecraft, thus necessitating a flexible experimental design to achieve the intended science goals. In fact, our sample return was delayed from 31 days to 34 days due to weather-related issues. Another constraint of spaceflight studies is that retrieving exact age-matched flies is often not feasible. Some of the previous spaceflight studies have been conducted on mixed-age populations of flies from different generations (depending on the mission’s timeline). But with the MVP hardware, the astronauts could accommodate multiple timed inflight operations, including a 5.5-day egglay period (Figure S1C), thus ensuring that the retrieved flies were from the same generation and within a relatively close age range (11-17 days). Our strategy of testing randomly selected flies from this collection ensured that the average ages were similar and allowed for an unbiased comparison across groups of flies. Further, spaceflight experiments are severely limited by mass and volume. Therefore, the number of samples retrieved is limited by the capacity of the flight hardware. In this experiment, a large population of live flies were retrieved from the MVP hardware, allowing us to conduct the presented experiments. Additional flies would have allowed for longitudinal multi-omic profiling at the R+25 time point but were unavailable for this experiment. The current study, MVP-FLY-01 mission, was an important one-time validation flight for the MVP hardware to demonstrate its ability to support Drosophila research on the ISS. After its successful validation, as demonstrated by this experiment, this hardware will form the framework for multiple Drosophila spaceflight investigations in the future.

PARÁGRAFO: The MVP-Fly01 mission (Figure 1A, B) was launched on SpaceX-14 to the ISS at 20:30 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on April 2nd, 2018. Flies were kept in the MVP hardware throughout the 34-day mission on the ISS (Figure S1A). The Dragon capsule was unberthed at 13:22 UTC on May 5th, 2018, and splashdown in the Pacific Ocean was the same day at 20:00 UTC. The mission used the MVP hardware (Redwire/Techshot, Inc., Greenville, Indiana) that supports easy food changes, allowing for a large population of flies to be maintained over multiple generations. It is also equipped with UI-1491LE video cameras used to capture time course footage of D. melanogaster (Figure S1B). The hardware consists of uniform white LED illumination which was programmed for a 12-hr:12-hr (light: dark) cycle for each habitat. Fresh cabin air was continuously circulated through the habitat to maintain steady CO2 and O2 levels. The housing system consists of two independent centrifuge units maintained within the same habitat enclosure, each containing six MVP modules (Figure S1A, B). For this experiment, one centrifuge was rotated at 68 rpm to artificially simulate Earth’s gravity (SF1g) in space. The other centrifuge was rotated at 2.2 rpm, making the g-level at the outer edge of the carousel at approximately 0.00095g (SFμg). This minimal rotation of SFμg ensured temperature uniformity between all experimental modules, while maintaining the microgravity levels of the ISS. Each MVP module has two adult fly chambers and three food cylinders (Figure S1B). Each food cylinder holds approximately 9.2 mL of standard fly food (Gilbert et al., 2020) containing foodgrade blue food dye. The presence of the dye allowed for the differentiation between early and late third instar larvae during postflight specimen sorting. Its inclusion is not relevant to the current analysis of adult flies performed here. The hardware design allowed for the passage of two generations of flies sequentially from adult fly chamber 2 to adult fly chamber 1 (Figure S1B). The MVP hardware has video imaging capabilities, and 28-second video footage of the adult fly chambers was taken regularly throughout the 12-hr light period. Although the MVP hardware has night video recording capability, it was not utilized in this mission due to technical difficulties with the infrared lighting.
PARÁGRAFO: Each 28-second video consisted of 368 frames with an image resolution of 1986×1064 pixels. This video was periodically checked during the mission to ensure the health of flies and gauge the overall well-being. Upon return, this video was analyzed for inflight behavior to compute adult fly activity in SF1g and SFμg conditions during the mission. Following the completion of the mission, the samples were returned to Port of Long Beach, California, and transported via a climate-controlled vehicle to NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), California, within 7 hours of landing. Temperature and humidity loggers were also programmed to monitor the samples throughout the journey. All dissections, fixation of brain tissue, and postflight behavioral analysis (described below) were performed within 24 hours of arrival at NASA ARC (Return+0 days = R+0). A small subset of flies separated by sex was placed in an incubator at 24°C for acclimation to earth condition for 25 days (Return+25 days = R+25), and the brains from these flies were processed for immunohistochemical analysis similar to R+0 flies (Figure 1B).
PARÁGRAFO: During the mission, a small set consisting of only two MVP modules (synchronous control) was reared in a ground-based incubator with real-time changes in temperature, humidity, and CO2 matching the telemetry recorded on the ISS. The synchronous control was checked periodically to ensure the overall health of the flies during the mission but was not used for any of the postflight analysis. Upon completing the mission, a postflight ground control with the same hardware used for the mission was conducted in a ground-based incubator with six MVP modules resulting in 883 flies. For the postflight control (Earth), flies were placed in each module to match the flight condition and were reared under identical conditions to match the temperature, relative humidity, O2, and CO2 levels recorded for the entire experiment on the ISS. The CO2 levels within habitats in space are often significantly higher than those on the ground due to the technical difficulty of scrubbing the CO2 from an entirely enclosed environment (ISS). The average CO2 level in the MVP hardware during this experiment ranged between 3500-5443 ppm during the mission and was replicated temporally and identically in the ground control. By comparison, the CO2 level under regular laboratory conditions averages <1000 ppm (Hussin et al., 2017). Also, another variable in any spaceflight study is sound pressure level. Based on ISS’s telemetry data and payload permissible limits, SF1g and SFμg flies in the MVP module on ISS experienced average sound pressure levels of 65dB. Similar sound pressure levels (62-65dB) were noted in the vicinity of the Earth controls placed in the laboratory incubator (Percival Scientific). The Earth control flies were fixed in RNAlater and subjected to postflight analyses following the same timeline as the flies from ISS. The Earth control used for comparison and statistical analysis in this manuscript is this postflight ground control.
PARÁGRAFO: The w1118 wildtype line (Bloomington Stock Center) was used in this study. Thirty hours prior to launch, one-day-old virgin male (10) and female (25) fruit flies were loaded into the adult food cylinder 3 in each of the six MVP modules (F0 generation). The food cylinder was then immediately opened to adult fly chamber 2 (Figure S1B, C). The modules were then placed inside of a standard cargo transfer bag for launch. Prepared food cylinders were stored at 4°C for the duration of launch and ISS operations. Approximately 3.7 days (90 hrs) after launch, the payload was delivered to the ISS and the crew installed a food cylinder 2 inside the MVP module and opened the food cylinder 2 to adult fly chamber 2 (Mission day=5), giving flies access to the new food. Food cylinder 3 was closed at this time. This procedure was repeated for all MVP modules, and the modules were loaded into the previously installed MVP habitat hardware (Figure S1A) by the ISS crew. At this time, the six SF1g modules started spinning at 68 rpm to maintain 1g in spaceflight while the six SFμg modules were maintained at microgravity levels.
PARÁGRAFO: After 5.5 days of egg laying (Mission Day=10), food cylinder 2 was opened to adult fly chamber 1 to allow the eggs laid in space to develop and emerge into adult flies in chamber 1. At the same time food cylinder 2 was closed to adult fly chamber 2, such that the launch populations of flies were prevented from entering food cylinder 2, thus keeping the generations separated (Figure S1C). Food cylinder 3 was reopened to adult fly chamber 2 to continue providing food to this population for the remainder of the experiment. The larvae and flies that emerged from the food cylinder 2 into the adult fly chamber 1 had undergone their entire developmental life cycle during spaceflight (F1 generation). At this time, food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1 to allow egg laying in cylinder 1, which will produce the second generation of spaceflight-developed flies (F2 generation). Food cylinder 2 remained open to chamber 1 during egg lay to allow adults to continue emerging. This also allowed us to know the age range of the adult flies returned for postflight experiments (~11-17-day adults).
PARÁGRAFO: After 8 days of egg laying, food cylinder 1 from each module containing F2 generation fruit fly eggs and larvae, and some F1 generation adults, was fixed in RNAlater (Invitrogen).
PARÁGRAFO: This allowed us to have samples that were fixed in RNAlater in space for “omics” analyses on the ground to track the progression of acclimation to spaceflight as animals develop in space under different gravity conditions. Following the fixation, a fresh food cylinder 1 was inserted and opened to chamber 1, and food cylinder 2 was closed. The MVP locker was powered down after the experiment, and fixed F1 generation flies and F2 generation eggs and larvae were placed in the MELFI-2 freezer at −80°C until the samples returned. Thus, this experimental design allowed us to freeze adult flies (F1 generation), larvae (F2 generation), and eggs (F2 generation) at Day 29. Postflight, we retrieved live adult flies (F1 generation), and eggs and larvae of F2 generation in the new food cylinder 1. All the science operations, including food cylinder changes and fixation and opening/closing of chambers, were performed by the ISS crew. Unforeseen weather conditions delayed the mission by 4 days, during which the crew repowered the MVP hardware on mission day 31 and powered it off on mission day 34 for return to Earth.
PARÁGRAFO: To quantify fly activity on the ISS, a simple but robust algorithm was developed using image-processing techniques in Matlab 2018 (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) and DIPimage (Hendriks et al. 1999) running on a MacBook Pro with an i7 core processor. Only the videos from adult fly chamber 1 SF1g and SFμg were analyzed in this study (Mission days 13 to 28 – Figure S1C) since these chambers contained the flies bred entirely in space (F1 generation). The age of the flies assessed from video imaging of the inflight behavior ranged from 1 to 16-days (Postflight assays were conducted with flies with a smaller age range as described in the relevant sections). Similar video recording arrangements were made for Earth condition, but the videos could not be recorded due to technical issues. Full resolution 8-bit images (1986x1064) were used for analysis. The individual frames from the video images have a predominant intensity in the blue channel (Figure 1C.i). Therefore, each video image was separated into its three RGB components, and the blue channel (shown in grayscale) was inverted and used for further analysis (Figure 1C.ii) as it provided best visualization of the flies. Once inverted, resulting images had individual flies that appeared as white pixels on a gray background. For each movie, maximum intensity projections (MIP) were computed by overlaying individual video frames and keeping the brightest pixels across all time points, resulting in a stroboscopic motion-like effect (Figure 1C.iii and 1C.iv). The pixel location of the MIP was mapped on a composite image to visualize the locomotion of individual flies during each video. These tracks had a higher intensity and appeared brighter than the background. Flies that did not move did not create a track, as seen between Figure 1C.ii and 1C.iii indicated in green. However, flies that were active during the video recording created a white track, shown in Figures 1C.ii and 1C.iii in blue and red. This process resulted in a single image that displayed the tracks of the fly population throughout a series of 28-second video recordings (Figure 1C.iv).
PARÁGRAFO: Using the MIP images of adult fly chamber 1, we could determine when flies were active. The videos from mission day 13 to 28 (Figure S1C) that tracked the F1 generation of flies as shown in Figures 1D, E. In other words, this time frame included initial fly emergence when the majority of the space-bred generation of flies entered adult fly chamber 1 from food cylinder 2 but ended prior to fly numbers and debris levels increasing to a point where the camera view was obstructed (Figure S2). The number of flies in a chamber increased over time due to reproduction based on the life cycle of D. melanogaster (Fernández-Moreno et al., 2007) (Figure S2). Six videos per day, each 28 seconds in duration that spanned the 12-hr light period, were processed to produce MIP images for each fly module. One of the six modules containing the population bred in μg malfunctioned during flight, so our analysis includes six modules in SF1g and five modules in SFμg. Videos from adult fly chamber 2 were not used for analysis because 1) the build-up of debris due to more extended periods of growth compared to adult fly chamber 1 obscured the camera view, and 2) the chamber contained mixed generations of flies. The pixel intensities were summed for each MIP image, resulting in a single numerical value for every video. The more a fly moves, the longer are the white streaks that can be observed along its path on the MIP and the higher is the total measured intensity. The process was repeated for each video producing a series of numerical values to quantify the overall activity of the fly population during the mission. Supplementary video 1, 2 is a representative video showing the fly chambers of SF1g and SFμg, where suspended flies are seen in microgravity condition. The color map in Figure 1D was generated by setting the minimum value in the color map to the baseline intensity obtained from the first frame of the video. The intensities across all modules and treatments were scaled such that the video with the MIP image having the highest summated intensity (and therefore highest activity) was set to the maximum color on the color scale (Figure 1D). Note: No videos were analyzed for activity past day 28 due to the increased fly numbers and debris interfering with the image quality.
PARÁGRAFO: Climbing assay was performed on F1 generation of flies returned to Earth using a modified version of Le Bourg and Lints (Feany and Bender, 2000). For each condition, flies were sorted and collected by sex, in groups of ten per food vial (F=100, M=100) as soon as the live flight samples were returned on earth (i.e., Fig. 1B, splash at L+34, 2 days for samples turnover (Long Beach, CA) and arrived at NASA ARC (R+0) and the assay was conducted.
PARÁGRAFO: During the climbing assay, flies were transferred to a clean, empty vial and allowed to adjust for 1 minute. The flies were tapped down to the bottom, and the number of flies climbing past the 5 cm mark measured from the bottom of the vial in 18 seconds was recorded as a percentage of flies able to climb per vial (climbing ability). This assay was repeated three times for each vial, with a 30 second rest between trials. An average of three trials was reported per vial.
PARÁGRAFO: Measurements from all three trials were averaged. The significance was determined between the conditions by a one-way ANOVA analysis with the condition as the independent variable.
PARÁGRAFO: F1 generation flies returned live were dissected (R+0 and R+25) and brains were immediately fixed for 20 minutes in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 6.7% sucrose, and 0.01% tween-20, and stored at 4°C in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide. The R+0 and R+25 brains were stained for immunohistochemical analysis (described below) where staining for different antibody markers was conducted at the same time to facilitate comparison and reduce variability. The brains were stained following a standard protocol (Iyer et al., 2018; Mhatre et al., 2014). Briefly, the fixed brains were washed with PBS and PBT (0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 10 min each, incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum (Catalog # 566380, Sigma) in PBT) for one hour, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. One set of brains were stained with anti-elav (1:100, Catalog # 7E8A10, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), host species - rat) to label all the neurons, anti-cc3 (1:100, Catalog # 9661, Cell signaling Technology, host species - rabbit) as apoptotic marker, and anti-8-oxo-dG (1:100, Catalog # 4354-MC-050, R&D systems, host species - mouse) as the DNA oxidative damage marker. Another set of brains were stained with anti-Repo (1:50, Catalog # 8D12, DSHB), University of Iowa, host species - mouse) to label the glia, and anti-TH (1:300, Catalog # AB152, EMD Millipore, host species - rabbit) to label the dopaminergic neurons. These preparations were then washed three times with PBT for 10 min each, and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies, Alexa fluor 568 goat anti-mouse (1:200; Catalog # A-11031, Invitrogen), Alexa fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:200; Catalog # A-11034, Invitrogen), or Alexa fluor 633 goat anti-rat (1:200; Catalog # A21094, Invitrogen). Final washes were performed once with PBT and twice with PBS, each for 10 min, and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, H-1000) for imaging.
PARÁGRAFO: Stained brains were imaged using Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope in the histology and microscopy core facility at the Gladstone Institute, University of California San Francisco (UCSF). The ELAV neuronal cortex, neuropil, and the total brain area were traced and quantified using Image J software (v1.52g, U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA). This method is a gross measurement adapted from previously published papers (Chakraborty et al., 2011; Mhatre et al., 2014). The data reported here are the neuronal cortex and neuropil area normalized to the total brain area. Similarly, the number of puncta for TH (total number of TH-positive cells), repo, 8-oxo-dG, and CC3 were analyzed and quantified for each stain/marker using the cell counter in ImageJ software and are reported as absolute values.
PARÁGRAFO: The food cylinders that were frozen on ISS were slow-thawed at 4°C before opening. Once thawed, cylinders were opened, and flies (F1 generation frozen at L+29 days) were removed and sorted by sex. The head was removed using spring scissors and placed in RNAlater to preserve the RNA and protein integrity. Total RNA was extracted using RNA/Protein Purification plus (Norgen) from adult heads with four biological replicates in each condition (12-15 heads per replicate). This kit isolated total RNA and protein from the same samples. Isolated RNA was used to perform paired-end RNA sequencing on Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform, with an average of 20M reads of PE150 per sample (Novogene, Sacramento, CA). Data validation and quality control with FASTQC were conducted by Novogene, Inc. The standardized Genelab pipeline was used for the analysis (Overbey et al., 2021). Briefly, raw RNA sequences were trimmed using Trim Galore! v0.6.2 (Krueger, 2019), aligned to the Drosophila reference genome (Dmel release 6.08) and transcriptome with STAR Version 2.7.1a (Dobin et al., 2013), and read counts for each transcript were generated using RSEM v1.3.1. Differentially expressed gene lists were generated using a custom Genelab R script, GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, utilizing the DESeq2 v1.22.2 R package (Lai Polo et al., 2020). False discovery rate (adjusted p-value) corrections were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment, and the differentially expressed genes with an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
PARÁGRAFO: Proteins isolated from adult heads (F1 generation frozen at L+29 days) using the Norgen Biotek kit were used to determine the global proteomic changes. Three replicates in each condition (12-15 heads per replicate) were used for protein isolation and enzymatic digestion. Isolated protein samples were digested and desalted according to Lundby et al. (Lundby et al., 2012). Protein concentrations were then determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Proteins were then reduced, alkylated and subjected to acetone precipitation prior to digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C, 1:50 enzyme to protein (Wako, Richmond, VA). This was followed by digestion with trypsin, 1:50 enzyme to protein (Promega, Madison, WI), and desalting and concentrating using C18 Sep-Pak cartridges (Waters).
PARÁGRAFO: Peptides were mass tagged using Thermo-Fisher’s TMT 10-plex isobaric label kit (Catalog # 90061) following the included protocol and pooled for analysis. Six experimental conditions were labeled in triplicate across three TMT-runs, including two internal control channels.
PARÁGRAFO: Pooled TMT-labeled peptides were fractionated by basic pH reversed-phase (BPRP) fractionation on an Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Thermo Scientific) using an integrated fraction collector. Elution was performed using a 10-minute gradient of 0-20% solvent B followed by a 50-minute gradient of solvent B from 20-45% (Solvent A 5.0% Acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0, Solvent B 90.0% Acetonitrile, 10mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8.0) on a Zorbax 300Extend-C18 column (Agilent) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. A total of 24 fractions were collected at 37-second intervals in a looping fashion for 60 minutes then combined to produce 12 super fractions. Peptide elution was monitored at a wavelength of 220nm using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 variable wavelength detector (Thermo Scientific). Each fraction was then centrifuged to near dryness and desalted using C18 Sep-Pak Cartridges followed again by centrifugation to near dryness and reconstitution with 20 ul of 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid.
PARÁGRAFO: BPRP fractions were then separated using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) on a self-packed C18 column (100 um x 35 cm). Separation was performed using a 180-minute gradient of solvent B from 2-27% (Solvent A 0.1% Formic Acid, Solvent B Acetonitrile, 0.1% Formic Acid) at 50°C using a digital PicoView nanospray source (New Objectives, Woburn, MA) that was modified with a custom-built column heater and an ABIRD background suppressor (ESI Source Solutions, Woburn, MA). An in-house column was prepared by packing a 100μm inner diameter picofrit column (New Objectives, Woburn, MA) with 1.9μm ReproSil-Pure C18 (Dr. Maisch, Ammerbuch, Germany) and packed to a length of 30 cm at 9000 psi using a nano-LC column packing kit (nanoLCMS, Gold River, CA).
PARÁGRAFO: Mass spectral analysis was performed using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). TMT analysis was performed using an MS3 multi-notch approach. The MS1 precursor selection range is from 400-1400 m/z at a resolution of 120K and automatic gain control (AGC) target of 2.0 x 105 with a maximum injection time of 100 ms. Quadrupole isolation at 0.7 Th for MS2 analysis using CID fragmentation in the linear ion trap with a collision energy of 35%. The AGC was set to 4.0 x 103 with a maximum injection time of 150ms. The instrument was operated in a top-speed data-dependent mode with a most intense precursor priority with dynamic exclusion set to an exclusion duration of 60 seconds with a 10ppm tolerance. MS2 fragment ions were captured in the MS3 precursor population. These MS3 precursors were then isolated within a 2.5 Da window and subjected to high energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) with a collision energy of 55%. The ions were then detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000 with an AGC of 5.0 x 104 and a maximum injection time of 150 ms. The data was then analyzed using SEQUEST (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, version v.27, rev. 11.) and Proteome Discoverer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA. version 2.1).
PARÁGRAFO: Tandem mass spectra were extracted, and charge states were deconvoluted by Proteome Discoverer version 2.1. Assignment of MS/MS spectra was performed using SequestHT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) by searching the data against a protein database, including all entries from the Uniprot Drosophila proteome (UniProt UP00000803, containing 21,041 sequences, download date 10-29-2019) combined with the common contaminants sequences from the Global Proteome Machine. Sequest searches were performed using a parent ion tolerance of 1.25 Da, fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.00005 Da, and requiring each peptides’ termini to have trypsin protease specificity while allowing up to two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.02146 Da) was set as static modification, while TMT tags on peptide N termini/lysine residues (+229.162932 Da), acetylation of the protein Nterminus, and methionine oxidation (+15.99492 Da) was set as variable modification. Reporter Ions Quantifier settings were set to include unique and razor peptides, Quan value correction factors from manufacturer applied, co-isolation threshold 50%, average reporter S/N 10, and no normalization or scaling of the channels.
PARÁGRAFO: The unscaled, non-normalized protein-level total reporter ion intensities derived from unique peptides were exported from Proteome Discoverer. Data quality assessment and control, normalization and analyses were performed using R v 4.0.1. Proteins underwent three filtering steps: 1) proteins containing missing values in any condition, 2) proteins with fewer than two unique peptide matches, and 3) proteins identified in only one or two out of the three runs were excluded from the quantitative analysis. Each TMT run was internally scaled, then transformed and analyzed together. Merged data were greatly affected by commonly seen batch effects associated to individual runs. Bioconductor package Limma v 3.44.3 was used to identify sexspecific abundance differences per protein in response to changing gravity conditions relative to ground/earth control by performing an empirical Bayes moderated t-test accounting for the seen batch effect caused by each individual TMT run (Ritchie et al., 2015). Calculated p-values were corrected by Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR). Statistically significant difference was defined by an FDR cutoff of 0.05.
PARÁGRAFO: The differentially expressed genes and proteins with FDR adjusted p-values less than 0.05 were used for further analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using Bioconductor package ClusterProfiler v 3.18.0 (Yu et al., 2012) and Drosophila database (org.Dm.eg.db version 3.13). Specifically, we used enrichGO and enrichKEGG functions to determine functionally enriched GO categories for are three annotations: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) and KEGG pathways (Carbon et al., 2021) for all contrasts across both transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. Results were visualized by R packages ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and pheatmap (Kolde, 2015). The intersecting genes and proteins within and across the multi-omics platform were plotted using the Upset plot (Khan and Mathelier, 2017). Pathway visualization was performed using the KEGG mapper function provided by Kanehisa Laboratories (https://www.kegg.jp/). Venn diagrams were generated using Venny 2.1 (Oliveros, 2015).
PARÁGRAFO: Quantification methods for the various assays and parameters are described in the relevant Methods section. Statistical analyses and plot generation were performed using GraphPad Prism software (v. 9.1.0). For Figure 1E, two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed to determine statistical significance. Grubbs test was performed on all climbing and immunohistochemistry datasets to remove outliers. In Figures 2, 6 (A–C, F), S3A, and S7, Grubbs test was followed by testing for normal Gaussian distribution via the D’AgostinoPearson test except in data with a low sample size (TH and Repo), where the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was performed. If data were normally distributed, a two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test, was performed to determine statistical significance. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
PARÁGRAFO: For Figure 6D, a non-parametric t-test (Mann-Whitney test) was performed to compare all conditions (Earth, SF1g, and SFμg) within their respective time points (R+0, R+25). A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The error bars in the figures represent SEM (Standard Error Mean). All data are means ± SEM (p < 0.05, n = 5-12 per group). The number of flies used per experiment is indicated in the figure legend. Inflight behavior analysis was conducted by composing Matlab code using Matlab 2018 (MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) and DIPimage (Hendriks et al. 1999).
PARÁGRAFO: Figure S1 (related to Figure 1A, B): MVP-FLY-01 hardware and mission timeline. (A) Representative image of the MVP Drosophila hardware. (B) MVP Drosophila unit -12 total units were installed in the MVP, six on each carousel. Each food cylinder was labeled in accordance with the actions detailed in Figure 2. The experiment was launched with flies in chamber 2/cylinder 3 and food in cylinder 3. Food cylinders 2 and 1 were not included in launch orientation. Each food cylinder had two openings, and the outer plastic vessel that contains the aluminum food cylinder had a single opening that rotated back and forth to give flies access to one side of the cylinder at a time. This allowed us to control entry of flies into the food cylinder from only a single adult fly chamber at a time, therefore controlling access to egg laying and allowed for separation of generations. Green arrows indicate the progression of the experiment throughout the mission. (C) Schematic of operations timeline onboard ISS during the experiment. The first yellow section represents the time between the packing of the hardware with flies and the time that the experiment began operation on ISS. The following red sections represent times that the modules were packed in cargo transfer bags, and the experiment was inactive. Colored blocks represent different phases of the experiment, which were separated by cylinder rotations and experiment operations. (Day 5) The MVP unit was powered on, and fruit fly food cylinder 2 was retrieved from 4°C storage and inserted into the module. The launch configuration allowed each module to have a food cylinder in the “food cylinder 3” slot, to support the first generation of flies during launch. After this time (the beige section), the initial generation of flies laid eggs in food cylinder 2. Food cylinder 3 was also temporarily closed, to encourage flies to lay eggs on the new food. (Day 10) Food cylinder 2 was rotated so that it faced chamber 1 (the blue section), and the new generation of eggs that were laid entirely in space would emerge into adults in fly chamber 1. This separates the initial adults from the food that contains the eggs for the next generation. Food cylinder 3 was also reopened to fly chamber 2. This allowed for the emergence of new flies, which were laid starting from Launch 1 day into Fly Chamber 2. (Day 21) Food cylinder 1 was retrieved from 4°C and installed. This allowed the flies emerging from cylinder 2 into fly chamber 1 to have fresh food and start laying the eggs that were ultimately fixed in RNAlater for other experiments on day 29. (Day 29) Cylinder 2 was closed off and rotated back to chamber 2, further preventing flies from emerging into chamber 1. A new food cylinder 1 was replaced to provide flies in chamber 1 with fresh food for the return journey. Chamber 1, at this point, only contained the complete generation of live flies bred entirely in space and returned for ground experiments. These flies were 11-17 days of age upon return. Videos from mission days 13-28 were analyzed for inflight behavioral assessments. (Day 31) A weather delay caused undocking to be pushed by at least 48 hrs. At this time, the flies were re-inserted into the MVP unit (yellow section) to avoid exposure of space 1g on-orbit control to the ISS micro-g for too long before sample return. (Day 33) MVP power was finally shut off for the journey back to Earth.

PARÁGRAFO: Figure S7 (related to Figure 6): Brain morphological assessment at the R+25 timepoint.

Two-way ANOVA results are displayed above the histogram. Significance calculated by post-hoc test is represented as *p<0.05; **p<0.01; *** p<0.001. The error bars represent SEM.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Suborbital spaceflights now enable human-tended research investigating short-term gravitational effects in biological systems, eliminating the need for complex automation. Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Alterations in immune function have been documented during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ cells, lower percentage of CD11c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage of CD11c+MHC I+ populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4+ population but increased CD4+CD25+ cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c+ population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c+MHC I+, CD11c+MHC II+, and CD11c+CD86+ cells compared to ground controls. Production of IFN-γ was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes. This study demonstrated that expression of surface molecules can be affected by conditions of spaceflight and impaired responsiveness persists under culture conditions in vitro.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: High-energy particle radiation could have a considerable impact on health during space missions. This study evaluated C57BL/6 mice on Day 40 after total-body 56Fe26+ irradiation at 0, 1, 2 and 3 gray (Gy). Radiation consistently increased thymus mass (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.005); spleen, liver and lung masses were similar among all groups. In the blood, there was no radiation effect on the white blood cell (WBC) count or major leukocyte types. However, the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and spontaneous blastogenesis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In contrast, splenic WBC, lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, %B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were all significantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of the irradiated groups compared with controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Although there were trends for minor, radiation-induced increases in %CD11b+ granulocytes in the spleen, cells double-labeled with adhesion markers (CD11b+CD54+, CD11b+CD62E+) were normal. Splenocyte spontaneous blastogenesis and that induced by mitogens (PHA, ConA, LPS) was equivalent to normal. In bone marrow, the percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers, Sca-1 and CD34/Sca-1, were low in one or more of the irradiated groups (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the data indicate that significant immunological abnormalities still exist more than a month after 56Fe irradiation and that there are differences dependent upon body compartment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The Space Shuttle Atlantis launched on its final mission (STS-135) on July 8, 2011. After just under 13 days, the shuttle landed safely at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the last time. Female C57BL/6J mice flew as part of the Commercial Biomedical Testing Module-3 (CBTM-3) payload. Ground controls were maintained at the KSC facility. Subsets of these mice were made available to investigators as part of NASA’s Bio-specimen Sharing Program (BSP). Our group characterized cell phenotype distributions and phagocytic function in the spleen, catecholamine and corticosterone levels in the adrenal glands, and transcriptomics/metabolomics in the liver. Despite decreases in most splenic leukocyte subsets, there were increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. Although there were increases noted in corticosterone levels in both the adrenals and liver, there were no significant changes in catecholamine levels. Furthermore, functional analysis of gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggest that the functional changes are not due to oxidative or psychological stress. Despite changes in gene expression patterns indicative of increases in phagocytic activity (e.g. endocytosis and formation of peroxisomes), there was no corresponding increase in genes related to ROS metabolism. In contrast, there were increases in expression profiles related to fatty acid oxidation with decreases in glycolysis-related profiles. Given the clear link between immune function and metabolism in many ground-based diseases, we propose a similar link may be involved in spaceflight-induced decrements in immune and metabolic function.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Increased oxidative stress is an unavoidable consequence of exposure to the space environment. Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: While many efforts have been made to pave the way toward human space colonization, little consideration has been given to the methods of protecting spacefarers against harsh cosmic and local radioactive environments and the high costs associated with protection from the deleterious physiological effects of exposure to high-Linear energy transfer (high-LET) radiation. Herein, we lay the foundations of a roadmap toward enhancing human radioresistance for the purposes of deep space colonization and exploration. We outline future research directions toward the goal of enhancing human radioresistance, including upregulation of endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, possible leeways into gene therapy in order to enhance radioresistance via the translation of exogenous and engineered DNA repair and radioprotective mechanisms, the substitution of organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and methods of slowing metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. We conclude by presenting the known associations between radioresistance and longevity, and articulating the position that enhancing human radioresistance is likely to extend the healthspan of human spacefarers as well.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: There is evidence that spaceflight poses acute and late risks to the central nervous system. To explore possible mechanisms, the proteomic changes following spaceflight in mouse brain were characterized. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission. Within 3–5 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Efforts to understand the impact of spaceflight on the human body stem from growing interest in long-term space travel. Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK) gene family is crucial to various molecular and cellular processes in plants. We identified 50 PERK genes in Brassica napus to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis-element analysis predicted the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein–protein interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon Plasmodiophora brassicae infection implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis perk9 mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, suggesting the negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity. The study highlighted the potential role of BnPERKs in crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The phosphoinositide pathway and inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) have been implicated in plant responses to many abiotic stresses; however, their role in response to biotic stress is not well characterized. In the current study, we show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca2+-release as well as the expressions of some flg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase plants. Furthermore, the InsP 5-ptase plants were more susceptible to virulent and avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. The InsP 5-ptase plants had lower basal salicylic acid (SA) levels and the induction of SAR in systemic leaves was reduced and delayed. Reciprocal exudate experiments showed that although the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective molecules that could trigger PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants, exudates collected from either wild type or InsP 5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally, expression profiles indicated that several defense genes including PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and AIG1 were basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type. Upon pathogen attack, expression of these genes was either not induced or showed delayed induction in systemic leaves. Our study shows that phosphoinositide signaling is one component of the plant defense network and is involved in both basal and systemic responses. The dampening of InsP3-mediated signaling affects Ca2+ release, modulates defense gene expression and compromises plant defense responses.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Although many reports characterize the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis seedlings to microgravity, few investigate the effect of partial or fractional gravity on gene expression. Understanding plant responses to fractional gravity is relevant for plant growth on lunar and Martian surfaces. The plant signaling flight experiment utilized the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The EMCS consisted of two rotors within a controlled chamber allowing for two experimental conditions, microgravity (stationary rotor) and simulated gravity in space. Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light in seed cassettes. The arrangement of the seed cassettes within each experimental container results in a gradient of fractional g (in the spinning rotor). To investigate whether gene expression patterns are sensitive to fractional g, we carried out transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed to microgravity or partial g (ranging from 0.53 to 0.88 g). Data were analyzed using DESeq2 with fractional g as a continuous variable in the design model in order to query gene expression across the gravity continuum. We identified a subset of genes whose expression correlates with changes in fractional g. Interestingly, the most responsive genes include those encoding transcription factors, defense, and cell wall-related proteins and heat shock proteins.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) applications in environmental, biomedical, agricultural, biological, and spaceflight research require an ion-selective electrode (ISE) that can withstand prolonged storage in complex biological media 1-4. An all-solid-state ion-selective-electrode (ASSISE) is especially attractive for the aforementioned applications. The electrode should have the following favorable characteristics: easy construction, low maintenance, and (potential for) miniaturization, allowing for batch processing. A microfabricated ASSISE intended for quantifying H+, Ca2+, and CO32- ions was constructed. It consists of a noble-metal electrode layer (i.e. Pt), a transduction layer, and an ion-selective membrane (ISM) layer. The transduction layer functions to transduce the concentration-dependent chemical potential of the ion-selective membrane into a measurable electrical signal.
PARÁGRAFO: The lifetime of an ASSISE is found to depend on maintaining the potential at the conductive layer/membrane interface 5-7. To extend the ASSISE working lifetime and thereby maintain stable potentials at the interfacial layers, we utilized the conductive polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) 7-9 in place of silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the transducer layer. We constructed the ASSISE in a lab-on-a-chip format, which we called the multi-analyte biochip (MAB) (Figure 1).
PARÁGRAFO: Calibrations in test solutions demonstrated that the MAB can monitor pH (operational range pH 4-9), CO32- (measured range 0.01 mM - 1 mM), and Ca2+ (log-linear range 0.01 mM to 1 mM). The MAB for pH provides a near-Nernstian slope response after almost one month storage in algal medium. The carbonate biochips show a potentiometric profile similar to that of a conventional ion-selective electrode. Physiological measurements were employed to monitor biological activity of the model system, the microalga Chlorella vulgaris.
PARÁGRAFO: The MAB conveys an advantage in size, versatility, and multiplexed analyte sensing capability, making it applicable to many confined monitoring situations, on Earth or in space.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The space race is entering a new era of exploration, in which the number of robotic and human missions to various places in our solar system is rapidly increasing. Despite the recent advances in propulsion and life support technologies, there is a growing need to perform analytical measurements and laboratory experiments across diverse domains of science, while keeping low payload requirements. In this context, lab-on-a-chip nanobiosensors appear to be an emerging technology capable of revolutionizing space exploration, given their low footprint, high accuracy, and low payload requirements. To date, only some approaches for monitoring astronaut health in spacecraft environments have been reported. Although non-invasive molecular diagnostics, like lab-on-a-chip technology, are expected to improve the quality of long-term space missions, their application to monitor microbiological and environmental variables is rarely reported, even for analogous extreme environments on Earth. The possibility of evaluating the occurrence of unknown or unexpected species, identifying redox gradients relevant to microbial metabolism, or testing for specific possible biosignatures, will play a key role in the future of space microbiology. In this review, we will examine the current and potential roles of lab-on-a-chip technology in space exploration and in extreme environment investigation, reporting what has been tested so far, and clarifying the direction toward which the newly developed technologies of portable lab-on-a-chip sensors are heading for exploration in extreme environments and in space.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The first genome sequenced of a eukaryotic organism was for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as reported in 1996, but it was more than 10 years before any of the zygomycete fungi, which are the early-diverging terrestrial fungi currently placed in the phyla Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota, were sequenced. The genome for Rhizopus delemar was completed in 2008; currently, more than 1000 zygomycete genomes have been sequenced. Genomic data from these early-diverging terrestrial fungi revealed deep phylogenetic separation of the two major clades—primarily plant—associated saprotrophic and mycorrhizal Mucoromycota versus the primarily mycoparasitic or animal-associated parasites and commensals in the Zoopagomycota. Genomic studies provide many valuable insights into how these fungi evolved in response to the challenges of living on land, including adaptations to sensing light and gravity, development of hyphal growth, and co-existence with the first terrestrial plants. Genome sequence data have facilitated studies of genome architecture, including a history of genome duplications and horizontal gene transfer events, distribution and organization of mating type loci, rDNA genes and transposable elements, methylation processes, and genes useful for various industrial applications. Pathogenicity genes and specialized secondary metabolites have also been detected in soil saprobes and pathogenic fungi. Novel endosymbiotic bacteria and viruses have been discovered during several zygomycete genome projects. Overall, genomic information has helped to resolve a plethora of research questions, from the placement of zygomycetes on the evolutionary tree of life and in natural ecosystems, to the applied biotechnological and medical questions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The motion of cells orthogonal to the direction of main flow is of importance in natural and engineered systems. The lateral movement of red blood cells (RBCs) distal to sudden expansion is considered to influence the formation and progression of thrombosis in venous valves, aortic aneurysms, and blood-circulating devices and is also a determining parameter for cell separation applications in flow-focusing microfluidic devices. Although it is known that the unique geometry of venous valves alters the blood flow patterns and cell distribution in venous valve sinuses, the interactions between fluid flow and RBCs have not been elucidated. Here, using a dilute cell suspension in an in vitro microfluidic model of a venous valve, we quantified the spatial distribution of RBCs by microscopy and image analysis, and using micro-particle image velocimetry and 3D computational fluid dynamics simulations, we analyzed the complex flow patterns. The results show that the local hematocrit in the valve pockets is spatially heterogeneous and is significantly different from the feed hematocrit. Above a threshold shear rate, the inertial separation of streamlines and lift forces contribute to an uneven distribution of RBCs in the vortices, the entrapment of RBCs in the vortices, and non-monotonic wall shear stresses in the valve pockets. Our experimental and computational characterization provides insights into the complex interactions between fluid flow, RBC distribution, and wall shear rates in venous valve mimics, which is of relevance to understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis and improving cell separation efficiency.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bioinformatics approaches have proven useful in understanding biological responses to spaceflight. Spaceflight experiments remain resource intensive and rare. One outstanding issue is how to maximize scientific output from a limited number of omics datasets from traditional animal models including nematodes, fruitfly, and rodents. The utility of omics data from invertebrate models in anticipating mammalian responses to spaceflight has not been fully explored. Hence, we performed comparative analyses of transcriptomes of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) in mice that underwent 37 days of spaceflight. Results indicate shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythm. EDL showed more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, possibly underlying its resistance to atrophy versus soleus. Spaceflight and hindlimb unloading mice shared differential regulation of proliferation, circadian, and neuronal signaling. Shared gene regulation in muscles of humans on bedrest and space flown rodents suggest targets for mitigating muscle atrophy in space and on Earth. Spaceflight responses of C. elegans were more similar to EDL. Discrete life stages of D. melanogaster have distinct utility in anticipating EDL and soleus responses. In summary, spaceflight leads to shared and discrete molecular responses between muscle types and invertebrate models may augment mechanistic knowledge gained from rodent spaceflight and ground-based studies.

PARÁGRAFO: Astronauts have been previously shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight, host factors that could contribute to oral diseases such as caries and periodontitis. However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.

PARÁGRAFO: Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nares of approximately 30% of humans, a risk factor for opportunistic infections. To gain insight into S. aureus virulence potential in the spaceflight environment, we analyzed RNA-Seq, cellular proteomics, and metabolomics data from the “Biological Research in Canisters-23” (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit on the international space station. This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground control and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 h. RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene transcript in spaceflight relative to ground controls. The agr operon gene transcripts were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding phenol-soluble modulins and secreted proteases, which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, type VII-like Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed secretome analysis of BRIC-23 culture supernatants, which revealed that spaceflight samples had increased abundance of secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA (secreted by the Ess system). These data also indicated that S. aureus metabolism is altered in spaceflight conditions relative to the ground controls. Collectively, these data suggest that S. aureus experiences increased quorum sensing and altered expression of virulence factors in response to the spaceflight environment that may impact its pathogenic potential.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS–SNARE interactions, which is similar to other eukaryotes. These results highlight both conserved and specific mechanisms for HOPS recruitment and function during vacuole fusion in plants.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Vacuoles are dynamic compartments with constant fluctuations and transient structures such as trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs. Bulbs are highly dynamic spherical structures inside vacuoles that are formed by multiple layers of membranes and are continuous with the main tonoplast. We recently carried out a screen for mutants with abnormal trafficking to the vacuole or aberrant vacuole morphology. We characterized regulator of bulb biogenesis1-1 (rbb1-1), a mutant in Arabidopsis that contains increased numbers of bulbs when compared to the parental control. rbb1-1 mutants also contain fewer transvacuolar strands than the parental control, and we propose the hypothesis that the formation of transvacuolar strands and bulbs is functionally related. We propose that the bulbs may function transiently to accommodate membranes and proteins when transvacuolar strands fail to elongate. We show that RBB1 corresponds to a very large protein of unknown function that is specific to plants, is present in the cytosol, and may associate with cellular membranes. RBB1 is involved in the regulation of vacuole morphology and may be involved in the establishment or stability of trans-vacuolar strands and bulbs.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The vacuole is an essential organelle in plant cells, and its dynamic nature is important for plant growth and development. Homotypic membrane fusion is required for vacuole biogenesis, pollen germination, stomata opening, and gravity perception. Known components of the vacuole fusion machinery in eukaryotes include SNARE proteins, Rab GTPases, phosphoinositides, and the homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex. HOPS function is not well characterized in plants, but roles in embryogenesis and pollen tube elongation have been reported. Here, we show that Arabidopsis HOPS subunits VPS33 and VPS41 accumulate in late endosomes and that VPS41, but not VPS33, accumulates in the tonoplast via a wortmannin-sensitive process. VPS41 and VPS33 proteins bind to liposomes, but this binding is inhibited by phosphatidylinosiltol-3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] and PtdIns(3,5)P2, which implicates a nonconserved mechanism for HOPS recruitment in plants. Inducible knockdown of VPS41 resulted in dramatic vacuole fragmentation phenotypes and demonstrated a critical role for HOPS in vacuole fusion. Furthermore, we provide evidence for genetic interactions between VPS41 and VTI11 SNARE that regulate vacuole fusion, and the requirement of a functional SNARE complex for normal VPS41 and VPS33 localization. Finally, we provide evidence to support VPS33 and SYP22 at the initial stage for HOPS–SNARE interactions, which is similar to other eukaryotes. These results highlight both conserved and specific mechanisms for HOPS recruitment and function during vacuole fusion in plants.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The spaceflight environment of the International Space Station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth including reduced gravity. Plants exposed to microgravity and other conditions on the ISS display root skewing, changes in gene expression and protein abundance that may result in changes in cell wall composition, antioxidant accumulation and modification of growth anisotropy. Systematic studies that address the effects of microgravity on cellular organelles are lacking but altered numbers and sizes of vacuoles have been detected in previous flights. The prominent size of plant vacuoles makes them ideal models to study organelle dynamics in space. Here, we used Arabidopsis zigzag-1 (zig-1) as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Wortmannin was used to induce vacuole fusion in seedlings and a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol was developed to visualize plant vacuole morphology after sample return, using confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that microgravity enhances the zig-1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth and vacuole fusion in some cells. This study demonstrates the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments for plant cell biology experiments in space.

PARÁGRAFO: Altered gravity load induced by spaceflight (microgravity) and centrifugation (hypergravity) is associated with changes in circadian, metabolic, and reproductive systems. Exposure to 2-g hypergravity (HG) during pregnancy and lactation decreased rate of mammary metabolic activity and increased pup mortality. We hypothesize HG disrupted maternal homeorhetic responses to pregnancy and lactation are due to changes in maternal metabolism, hormone concentrations, and maternal behavior related to gravity induced alterations in circadian clocks. Effect of HG exposure on mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism, plasma hormones and maternal behavior were analyzed in rat dams from mid-pregnancy (Gestational day [G]11) through early lactation (Postnatal day [P]3); comparisons were made across five time-points: G20, G21, P0 (labor and delivery), P1 and P3. Blood, mammary, liver, and adipose tissue were collected for analyzing plasma hormones, glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids, or gene expression. Maternal behavioral phenotyping was conducted using time-lapse videographic analyses. Dam and fetal-pup body mass were significantly reduced in HG in all age groups. HG did not affect labor and delivery; however, HG pups experienced a greater rate of mortality. PRL, corticosterone, and insulin levels and receptor genes were altered by HG. Mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism and expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolism were altered by HG exposure. Exposure to HG significantly changed expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver and circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. Gravity load alterations in dam's circadian system may have impacted homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation.
PARÁGRAFO: Keywords: Circadian, Hypergravity, Homeorhesis, Lactation, Mammary, Pregnancy
PARÁGRAFO: At varying phases of the life cycle, there are differential nutrient requirements. During pregnancy and lactation, an immense demand for nutrients sustains these challenging physiological states in the mother and fosters growth and development of the fetus and neonate. To support fetal and neonatal growth, major changes in the partitioning of available nutrients occur in maternal tissues, including coordinated shifts in mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism that do not jeopardize maternal homeostasis or fetal and neonatal health (Bauman and Currie, 1980). Homeorhetic adaptations are the “coordinated changes in metabolism of body tissues necessary to support a (dominant) developmental or physiological process” (Bauman and Currie, 1980; Bell and Bauman, 1997). Whereas homeostasis is widely understood to describe compensatory mechanisms that preserve the relative constancy of functions despite external challenges, homeorhesis refers to regulatory processes that support developmental or physiological processes of highest priority (Bauman et al., 1982). Homeorhetic controls regulate nutrient partitioning during pregnancy, thereby assuring growth of the conceptus as well as development of the mammary gland. With the onset of lactation, many maternal tissues undergo further adaptations to support milk synthesis.
PARÁGRAFO: During gestation, the endocrine system coordinates the mother's metabolic activities with the physiological requirements of the fetuses and subsequent nutritional demands of the suckling offspring. Mammary gland development and differentiation during pregnancy is the direct result of a network of changes in hormone levels, substrate availability and behavioral adaptations that collectively result in optimal milk production during lactation. During pregnancy, estrogen, progesterone, placental lactogen and the anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin (PRL), stimulate mammary growth and differentiation. At parturition, changes in these hormones act to stimulate the onset of lactation (Tucker, 1987; Freeman et al., 2000; Neville et al., 2001; Kelly et al., 2002). Periparturient changes in maternal metabolism include: 1) increased hepatic gluconeogenesis from endogenous substrates, 2) decreased peripheral tissue glucose utilization, 3) increased fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, and 4) increased amino acid mobilization from muscle (Chaves and Herrera, 1978; Martin-Hidalgo et al., 1994; Bell, 1995). Thus to insure adequate milk production and simultaneously maintain maternal homeostasis, the lactating dam utilizes homeorhetic processes to shift her metabolism.
PARÁGRAFO: The dam's normal homeorhetic response to the increased nutrient and energy demands of milk synthesis were mediated in part by global changes in gene transcription in mammary, liver and adipose including changes in clock genes that regulate circadian rhythms (Casey et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2011). Changes in molecular clocks during the transition from pregnancy to lactation in relation to other transcriptional profiles of mammary, liver and adipose tissues suggested that homeorhetic adaptation to lactation may be by coordinated in part by the circadian system. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes and can be entrained by external cues (Hastings et al., 2007). Although light is the primary environmental cue that entrains circadian clocks, gravity significantly affects circadian patterns of behavior, hormones, body temperature, and metabolism (Czeisler et al., 1991; Whitson et al., 1995; Fuller et al., 2000; Murakami and Fuller, 2000; Robinson and Fuller, 2000; Dijk et al., 2001; Fuller et al., 2002; Holley et al., 2003).
PARÁGRAFO: Gravity is an environmental stimulus that exerts major influences on animal physiology and behavior (Sonnenfeld, 2005). Similar to other environmental stimuli, such as temperature and light, animals have adapted to the Earth's gravitational force. In mammals, sudden deviations from Earth's 1-g environment are associated with significant physiological changes, including altered reproductive capability (Tou et al., 2002). Studies investigating the effects of gravity and circadian rhythms on reproducing and developing mammals can provide unique biomedical perspectives on these life processes on Earth (Ronca, 2007).
PARÁGRAFO: We previously identified gravity as an environmental variable that produces major graded changes in mammary metabolic activity and reduces pup survival (Ronca et al., 2001; Plaut et al., 2003). We and others showed that survival rates of pups born to rat dams exposed to 1.5- to 2-times Earth's gravity during the latter half of pregnancy were reduced by 5 to 40% (Megory and Oyama, 1984; Baer et al., 2000; Ronca et al., 2001). However, if neonatal pups were removed from the hypergravity environment and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (Baer et al., 2000). These data suggest that the dam's normal homeorhetic response to the onset of lactation was altered in hypergravity, thereby decreasing her ability to nurture pups. Although HG dams had reduced body fat and mass, these factors did not account for altered rates of lipid metabolism in mammary, liver and adipose tissues or decreased neonatal survival (Lintault et al., 2007). Further, neither prolactin nor glucocorticoid supplementation reversed the HG induced reduction in metabolic rates, suggesting that factors other than circulating lactogenic hormone levels and dam body composition were negatively impacting the dams' homeorhetic response to pregnancy and lactation (Patel et al., 2008). Collectively, these findings indicate a disruption of homeorhetic mechanisms that normally allow the dam to maintain homeostasis while simultaneously providing for growing fetuses and neonates.
PARÁGRAFO: In the present study, we measured the effect of exposure to 2-g from mid-gestation (gestational day [G]11 of the rat's 22-day pregnancy) throughout early lactation (until Postnatal day [P]3) on metabolic activity of mammary, liver and adipose tissue as well as circulating hormone and metabolite levels, and maternal behavior in relation to pup survival. We tested whether hypergravity affects homeorhetic responses in the dam thereby affecting lipid metabolism and pup survival. We also examined the hypothesis that alterations to the dam's circadian system induced by changes in gravitational force may limit homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation.
PARÁGRAFO: Body mass was 21%, 19%, 10%, 17% and 13% lower in G20, G21, P0, P1 and P3 HG dams versus control dams, respectively (supplementary material Table S1). Mammary glands were significantly (p<0.05) smaller in HG (1.80±0.12g) versus control (2.19±0.11g) dams on G20; however, the change in size was proportional to the change in overall body mass (0.6% for both treatments). Increased gravity-load did not significantly affect liver mass of pregnant dams. Body composition differed across conditions with HG dams having significantly less body fat than control dams (percent total body fat on P1: control, 27.1±1.2, HG, 18.7±2.2; on P3: control, 19.3±1.9, HG, 13.4±1.5; p<0.05).
PARÁGRAFO: There were no differences between HG and control in the numbers of fetuses on either G20 or G22 or in proportions of live births on P0. Gestational length was comparable for HG and control dams, as evidenced by day of parturition (G22/23). There were no differences in the overall amount of time spent in labor and parturition. The increased gravitational load did not affect litter size (No. pups per litter: HG 12±3; control 12±3) or male: female ratio (control % male: female, 47±3: 53±3; HG % male: female, 48±3: 52.±3). However, there was a significant (p<0.05) difference in pup survival across treatment conditions (HG: P0, 95%, P1, 57%, P3, 48%; Control: 100% at all ages). During late pregnancy, G20 and G22 fetuses exposed to 2-g hypergravity weighed 27% less than fetuses from control dams (p<0.05) (Table 1). Furthermore, placental weights were reduced, but were proportional to the body mass of the fetus. During early lactation, although HG pups increased body mass, they weighed approximately 20% and 30% less than control pups on P1 and P3, respectively (p<0.05) (Table 1). Though not different in fetuses, crown rump length was shorter in HG animals after birth (Table 1).
PARÁGRAFO: In the first four days after initial exposure to hypergravity (G12–15), control and HG dams exhibited similar levels of overall activity during the light phase of the circadian cycle, but HG dams showed significantly reduced activity as compared to control dams during the dark phase (p<0.05) (Fig. 1). During the 48 h just prior to parturition (G20–21), control dams reduced their overall activity during the dark phase of the cycle but HG dams maintained higher activity levels (p<0.05). An analysis of specific behavioral activities revealed that compared to control dams, HG dams spent more time eating/drinking and more time digging/nest-building but less time self-grooming and rearing offspring.
PARÁGRAFO: Values are mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.
PARÁGRAFO: Following birth (P1), HG dams were less active and spent less time self-grooming and eating/drinking than controls (Table 2). Self-grooming, but not other general activities, remained low on P3. On P1 maternal behavior differed between HG and control dams. HG dams spent more time building nests and nursing, but time spent licking and time spent retrieving pups were not significantly altered (Table 2).
PARÁGRAFO: On PO, plasma PRL levels were 5 times greater in HG dams than in control dams (p<0.05) (Fig. 2A). There were no differences in plasma PRL concentrations between the treatments on any other day. Although plasma levels of corticosteroids did not vary by day of pregnancy or lactation in either treatment group, the plasma Cort levels were reduced by approximately 50% in HG versus control dams at all periparturient stages (p<0.05) (Fig. 2B). INS was higher at G21 then decreased for the remainder of the study in both control and HG dams. INS concentrations differed between the treatments only on P3 (p<0.05) (Fig. 2C). On P3 concentrations of TSH, T4 and T3 were not altered in HG compared to control treated dams (data not shown). LEP levels on P3 were significantly reduced (p<0.05) in HG (13.5±4.2ng/ml) compared to control (48.7±13.1ng/ml) dams. Plasma cholesterol was increased on G21 in HG but subsequently values were reduced on P0 and P1 (Table 3). Plasma triglyceride levels were significantly altered in HG dams on G20 and P3; however, glucose and total protein concentrations were not altered by HG (Table 3).
PARÁGRAFO: Values are mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05. (A) Concentrations of PRL in plasma of rat dams during the periparturient period. (B) Concentrations of Cort in plasma in rat dams during the periparturient period. (C) Concentrations of INS in plasma in rat dams during the periparturient period.
PARÁGRAFO: Hypergravity exposure had an overall effect of reducing the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 in mammary tissue across all days measured in the peripartuirent period (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3A). The difference in glucose oxidation in mammary tissue was most pronounced on P1, when mammary tissue from control animals oxidized 2.7 times more glucose to CO2 in 1h than mammary tissue from HG dams (Fig. 3A). Glucose incorporation into lipids was also affected by increased g-load. During lactation P1 dams exhibited a six-fold reduction in the rate of lipid synthesis from glucose (Fig. 3B). Metabolic activity was decreased from 996±147nmoles of glucose/h in control dams to 150±147nmoles of glucose/h in HG dams (p<0.0001). After 3 days of lactation this difference was still evident, as 1.7 times more nmoles of glucose/h were incorporated into lipids in mammary tissue from control versus HG dams (p<0.03) (Fig. 3B).
PARÁGRAFO: Tissue slices were incubated in Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate (KRB) buffer in the presence of 1μCi/flask U-14C-glucose as a tracer. Glucose oxidation to CO2 was measured and expressed as nmoles of glucose utilized per 100mg tissue/hr. Rate of glucose incorporation into lipids was measured and expressed as nmoles glucose incorporated into lipids/100mg tissue/hr. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05. (A) Glucose oxidation to CO2 in mammary tissue. (B) Glucose incorporation to lipids in mammary tissue. (C) Glucose oxidation to CO2 in liver tissue. (D) Glucose incorporation to lipids in liver tissue. (E) Glucose oxidation to CO2 in adipose tissue; expressed as 1 hr per 1 million adipocytes. (F) Glucose incorporation to lipids in adipose tissue; expressed as 1 hr per 1 million adipocytes.
PARÁGRAFO: Increased gravity-load significantly reduced the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 in liver tissue from periparturient dams (p<0.005) (Fig. 3C). The difference was most pronounced in rats on P3. Control animals oxidized 40% more glucose to CO2 than HG treated dams (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3C). Although there were significant differences in the rates of glucose incorporation into lipids between treatments (p<0.005), the rates were very low in liver tissue from all groups examined, regardless of physiological state or gravitational force. There was a significant interaction in liver lipid synthesis between pregnancy and lactation. During pregnancy, lipid synthesis from glucose was higher in HG dams than control. On G21, liver tissue from HG dams incorporated approximately 2.7 fold more glucose into lipids than liver tissue from control dams (p<0.05) (Fig. 3D). During lactation, the relationship reversed, with liver tissue from control dams having a greater rate of glucose incorporation into lipids than HG treated dams. Control dams incorporated approximately 4-fold more glucose into lipids than liver tissue from HG dams at both P1 and P3 (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3D). Since glucose is not a major substrate for lipid synthesis in liver tissue, and low levels of liver lipid synthesis from glucose has been previously reported (Clark et al., 1974), we verified findings using acetate as a substrate and observed much higher rates of lipid synthesis, but found exactly the same pattern of response (data not shown).
PARÁGRAFO: Glucose oxidation to CO2 in adipose tissue was reduced in dams exposed to 2-g. At all time-points, except during labor and delivery, glucose incorporation into lipids was reduced by at least 70% in HG dams, regardless of whether data were expressed as per mg of tissue or per million adipocytes (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3E). On P1, adipose tissue from control dams incorporated 2.5 times more glucose into lipids than HG treated dams (p<0.0001) (Fig. 3F). Lypolysis, measured as glycerol release, was significantly reduced in HG dams when compared to control dams. On P1, the amount of glycerol released due to lypolysis was 80% more in adipose tissue from control dams than from HG dams (p<0.05) (data not shown). On P3, the rate of glycerol released during 1h was 60% greater in tissue from control dams versus HG treated dams (p<0.05) (data not shown).
PARÁGRAFO: Gene expression of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and hormone receptors for glucocorticoids and PRL were measured in total RNA isolated from mammary, liver, and adipose tissue collected on G20 and P1 from HG and control treated dams. Importantly, there was no difference in levels of housekeeping genes between the treatments. There was a significant day, treatment, and day by treatment interaction in mammary tissue. In general lipid metabolic enzymes increased from pregnancy to lactation and were reduced in HG treated dams relative to controls. Mammary specific gene expression of Acaca, Acly, and Lpl increased significantly from G20 to P1 with a 5.6 fold, 3.2 fold and 4.7 fold increase, respectively, (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4) in control dams. Expression of the Prlr also increased significantly from late pregnancy to day 1 lactation, by 5.6 fold (p<0.001) (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4) in control dams. Gene expression of Acaca, Acly, Lpl and the hormone receptors were significantly reduced in mammary tissue from HG dams relative to control dams on G20 and P1. Expression of Acaca was 4.5 times greater in mammary tissue from control versus HG dams on G20 and this difference increased to 11 times greater in control versus HG dams on P1. The increased difference between gene expression from pregnancy to lactation between mammary tissue from control and HG dams was due to the relatively small changes in gene expression that occurred in mammary tissue from HG dams. Thus a significant interaction between stage and g-load treatment resulted for the metabolic enzymes and the Prlr because the magnitude of increase in gene expression from pregnancy to lactation was minimal in HG animals (supplementary material Table S2). In fact the expression of Lpl was reduced by 45% from G20 to P1 in HG rats. Expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) in mammary tissue from HG dams was reduced compared to control; however, its expression was not different with physiological state (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4).
PARÁGRAFO: Total RNA was isolated from (A) mammary, (B) liver, and (C) adipose of late pregnant (G20) and early lactation (P1) control and HG treated dams. Expression of Acaca, Acyl, Lpl, GR and Prlr were measured using rt-q-PCR. Actb and B2m were used as reference genes and relative gene expression (RQ) was calculated using the delta-delta CT method with mean G20 control delta CT as normalizer. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.
PARÁGRAFO: In liver tissue from control dams, gene expression of Acaca, Acly, the glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) and Prlr decreased between late pregnancy and lactation by approximately 50%, 25%, 33% and 75%, respectively (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). There was no change in Fasn or Lpl gene expression between late pregnancy and the first day of lactation in liver tissue from control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Acaca, Acly, and glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) expression were significantly reduced by hypergravity exposure (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). There was a significant treatment by stage interaction in all genes except Acaca (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). On the first day of lactation the expression Acly was 53% lower and Fasn was 69% lower in liver tissue from hypergravity treated dams versus the controls, while expression of Lpl, glucocorticoid receptor and Prlr did not change due to hypergravity. Similar to control dams, liver tissue from HG dams also exhibited a decrease in, Acaca, Acly, and Prlr gene expression from G20 to P1; however, the differences were greater between these days for HG dams, with a 60%, 67%, and 82% decrease in expression, respectively, relative to control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Fasn gene expression decreased 78% and Lpl gene expression decreased 50% from pregnancy to lactation in HG dams versus no change in gene expression in liver tissue from control dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4).
PARÁGRAFO: There were no significant changes from G20 to P1 in the gene expression of the lipid metabolic enzymes or the hormone receptors measured in adipose tissue from control or HG dams (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4). Furthermore there was no difference in expression of metabolic genes or hormone receptors due to hypergravity exposure (supplementary material Table S2; Fig. 4).
PARÁGRAFO: Expression of the positive limb core molecular clock genes (Arntl, Npas2) and genes that regulate (Rora, Nr1d1, Csnk1e, Bhlhe40) molecular clocks were measured in mammary and liver from control and HG dams to determine if changes in gravity impacted circadian clocks (Fig. 5). Expression of the core clock genes Arntl and Npas2 in mammary were significantly greater (p<0.05) (Fig. 5A) on P1 compared to G20 at the same time-point (approximately 6 h after lights on) in control dams. There was no significant difference in expression of Arntl and Npas2 between G20 and P1 in HG dams, and expression of these genes were significantly less on P1 in HG versus control dams. Expression of Rora, a gene that stimulates expression of Arntl, was significantly higher on P1 compared to G20 in both treatments; however, in mammary of HG dams Rora was approximately 46% less than the control level. Mammary expression of Bhlh40e, Cnskle, and Nr1d1, were significantly decreased (p<0.05) on P1 compared to G20 in both control and HG dams, and expression of Bhlh40e was significantly less in HG compared to control dams on G20.
PARÁGRAFO: Total RNA was isolated from (A) mammary and (B) liver of late pregnant (G20) and early lactation (P1) control and HG treated dams. Expression of Arntl, Npas2, Rora, Bhlh40e, Csnk1e, and Nr1d1 were measured using rt-q-PCR. Actb and B2m were used as reference genes in mammary and liver, respectively, and relative gene expression (RQ) was calculated using the delta-delta CT method with mean G20 control delta CT as normalizer. Values are expressed as mean ±SEM; to determine probability of difference, ANOVA was used with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects; *indicates significant difference between treatments at p<0.05.
PARÁGRAFO: Expression of Arntl and Npas2 were significantly (p<0.05) (Fig. 5B) increased from G20 to P1 in the liver of control (approximately 10-fold and 16-fold, respectively) and HG (2-fold and 4.4-fold, respectively) dams. On G20, expression of Arntl was 18-fold and Npas2 was almost 6-fold higher in HG versus control dams (p<0.05). Expression of Arntl and Npas2 were also significantly greater on P1 in HG versus control dams (p<0.05; 2.3-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively). There was no significant difference in Rora expression in liver from late pregnant versus early lactation dams in both treatments, but on P1 expression of Rora was 50% higher in HG dams (p<0.05). There were no differences in expression of Csnk1e between late pregnancy and lactation within treatments or between treatments on G20 or P1. There was a significantly lower level of Nr1d1 liver expression on P1 compared to G20 in control animals, but the difference between Nr1d1 expression on G20 and P1 was not different in liver of HG animals. On both days expression of Nr1d1was significantly less in HG dams compared to control dams.
PARÁGRAFO: Our data suggest that hypergravity exposure causes a shift in maternal metabolism from reproductive to maternal survival at the expense of pup survival. These results have made us keenly aware of the vital role of environmental adaptation in long-term species survival.
PARÁGRAFO: Exposure of pregnant rat dams starting in mid-pregnancy to hypergravity resulted in decreased fetal-pup body mass, reductions in total body fat, and a reduction in survival. The presence of a similar number of fetuses and live births at the normal delivery time between treatments suggest that prenatal development continues to proceed in HG. However, 24 hours after birth survival was significantly reduced. Reduced pup survival was likely due to changes in maternal-pup interactions or changes in maternal physiology, as when pups were removed from the hypergravity environment at birth and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (Baer et al., 2000). Thus the present study focused on the behavioral and physiological status of the dams during the periparturient period.
PARÁGRAFO: During the first 24 hours after birth, approximately 50% of the pups survived at 2-g. Pup mortality coincided with altered maternal behavior in HG animals, which was marked by less time digging/nesting behavior and self-care (eating, drinking and grooming). These observations are consistent with previous reports of periparturient rats exposed to 1.5-g (Ronca et al., 2001), and may reflect a reduction in types of behaviors that require effort against the gravity vector.
PARÁGRAFO: HG dams also spent significantly more time nursing, which is consistent with our previous observation that primiparous dams exposed to hypergravity spend more overall time nursing with increased interruption of nursing bouts due to digging/nest-building behavior (Baer et al., 2005).
PARÁGRAFO: Pups of HG dams showed evidence of milk in the stomach (visualized through the pups' translucent skin), although limited analysis of milk bands revealed that they weighed less than the controls. Maternal care of pups in the hypergravity environment was intact as measured by licking, retrieving and nursing pups. It is not clear whether increased nursing may have contributed to pup mortality, for example by smothering pups during extended nursing bouts. Increased nursing time and smaller milk bands may reflect complications with lactation or inefficient milk transfer. Focus was therefore directed at alterations in dam metabolism specifically geared toward lactation.
PARÁGRAFO: Dams exposed to 2-g had significantly reduced body mass, 17% less than controls, and the reduction in body mass persisted throughout the study. Dam body mass decreased during the first 3 days of hypergravity exposure due to reduced daily food and water intake. After 3 days the animals acclimated to the hypergravity, food intake increased and weight gain rate became similar to controls (for details, see Lintault et al., 2007). Although the litters from HG dams were 20% smaller, it only accounted for 8g (7g for pups and 1g due to placental mass) of the total the difference in average dam mass (59g) between the treatments (supplementary material Table S1). Therefore the majority of difference in dam body mass was not due to the smaller litters, rather it was due to loss of maternal tissue, as was evident in mammary glands, which were significantly smaller in HG dams on G20 and accounted for approximately 4g of tissue loss. Hypergravity exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the mean size of adipocytes (data not shown), and overall reduction in total body fat of dams (for details, see Lintault et al., 2007). The reduction in dam body fat is likely due to increased energy demands in the hypergravity environment, and may cause a conflict between meeting maternal and pup energy needs.
PARÁGRAFO: As anticipated, mammary metabolic rate increased from pregnancy to lactation in both HG and control dams. However, hypergravity exposure decreased lipid synthesis by approximately 70% and glucose oxidation by approximately 25% at all stages, which is consistent with our previous findings (Plaut et al., 1999a; Plaut et al., 2003). The reduction in mammary metabolism may play a significant role in neonatal mortality. Analysis of expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolic rate: ATP-citrate lyase (Acly), acetyl co-A carboxylase (Acaca), fatty acid synthetase (Fasn) and lipoprotein lipase (Lpl) revealed a dramatic increase from late pregnancy to the first day of lactation in mammary gland of control dams. However, the change in gene expression between late pregnancy and the first day of lactation was greatly diminished in mammary tissue from HG treated dams relative to control dams. These data suggest that the decrease in mammary lipid metabolic rate and suppression of genes involved in lipid metabolism resulted in impaired milk production in HG dams. Mammary composition was not evaluated in our study, but it may have affected mammary metabolic output. For example milk production is believed to be a function of the number and secretory activity of epithelial cells (Knight and Peaker, 1982), so if there was less parenchymal tissue in HG dams, it would be expected that they have a decreased ability to produce milk. Secondly, the first fat for milk synthesis is likely mobilized from what is remaining of the mammary fat pad during the early postpartum period (Rudolph et al., 2007), and thus a lower mammary fat content may limit the energy content of milk.
PARÁGRAFO: To determine whether the metabolic response was limited to mammary tissue or if it also occurred in tissues that worked in concert with mammary tissue during lactation, glucose metabolism was measured in adipose and liver tissue. Our data demonstrate that both g-load and gestation day influenced glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. Increased gravity-load decreased metabolic rate in adipose tissue, including rate of lipolysis during lactation. Adipose tissue is a major source of metabolic fuel stored as triglycerides (Frühbeck et al., 2001), and at the onset of lactation, fat depots are mobilized through an increased rate of lipolysis, which accommodates the high energy demands of milk synthesis in the mammary gland (Williamson, 1986). Lower rates of adipose tissue metabolism in the hypergravity environment may be indicative of limited supplies of triglycerides for milk fat synthesis.
PARÁGRAFO: During lactation glucose oxidation to CO2 in liver tissue of HG dams was less than in control dams. The rate of glucose incorporation into lipid increased almost 4-fold from late pregnancy to the onset of lactation in control dams, demonstrating the increase in hepatic capacity at the onset of lactation to supply fatty acids to the mammary gland for milk synthesis (Williamson, 1980; Williamson, 1986). This increase did not occur in HG dams, which had suppressed rates of glucose incorporation into lipids compared to controls during lactation. At the molecular level expression of the lipid metabolic genes Acaca, Acly and Fasn were lower in liver tissue from HG versus control dams on the first day of lactation. Together, metabolic data revealed that exposure to increased gravity load caused a decrease in the capacity to oxidize glucose or incorporate glucose into lipid in all three tissues during lactation. This shift in tissue metabolic capacity is likely indicative of an extra energy investment in the hypergravity environment that overrides the normal maternal homeorhetic adaptation to lactation.
PARÁGRAFO: The regulation of metabolism in the lactating rats, in particular milk production, is dependent on PRL, cortisol, INS, and thyroid hormones (Williamson, 1986). In the present study there were no significant alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations. In an earlier study, we reported TSH to be elevated only at one time-point post-delivery (P15) with no other differences noted over time in TSH, T3 or T4 (Sajdel-Sulkowska et al., 2001). Therefore, it appears that thyroid status does not contribute to alterations in maternal metabolism or behavior leading to reduced pup survival.
PARÁGRAFO: Surprisingly, PRL concentrations were significantly higher at P0 in HG dams but not different from controls at any other time-point, although the data were extremely variable. The higher plasma PRL levels may reflect the lower expression of Prlr in HG dams (Fig. 4) since low receptor levels may trigger PRL secretion (Holcomb et al., 1976; Durand and Djiane, 1977) or may be an effort by the body to increase receptor levels, as PRL is known to auto-induce its own receptor at delivery (McNeilly and Friesen, 1977). In contrast to our study, others reported reduced PRL levels in pregnant and lactating dams exposed to hypergravity (Megory and Oyama, 1984; Megory and Oyama, 1985; Baer et al., 2002). Discrepancy in results among studies may be due to variations in sampling times in relation to parturition, suckling or circadian rhythms. Thus it is unclear if the observed treatment differences in PRL concentrations contribute to the differences in maternal behavior, pup mortality, or metabolic rate between control and HG dams. Although, it is important to note that our previous study showed daily PRL administration could not reverse impact of hypergravity on tissue metabolic rate (Patel et al., 2008).
PARÁGRAFO: Plasma Cort levels were significantly reduced in HG compared to control dams at all time-points. Decreased levels of plasma Cort in HG dams coincide with changes in rates of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in mammary, liver and adipose tissue. However, it is not likely that lower Cort levels caused these changes, as when HG treated pregnant rat dams were supplemented with Cort, we found no effect on rates of glucose oxidation or lipogenesis in any of the three tissues (Patel et al., 2008), thus indicating that the lower levels of Cort alone do not cause the observed alterations in rates of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis.
PARÁGRAFO: INS levels were significantly less in lactating HG treated animals compared to controls. Lower INS concentrations accompanied no change in plasma glucose concentrations, suggesting an increase in INS sensitivity in hypergravity, as the glucose to INS ratio was greater. LEP levels were also significantly less in lactating HG treated dams, which corresponded with the significantly lower circulating levels of cholesterol and triglyceride as well as reduced body fat in these dams on P3. Serum levels of LEP reflect the amount of energy stored in adipose tissue as well as short-term energy imbalance. Hormonal factors also regulate LEP levels. LEP functions to communicate the status of energy reserves with the central nervous system for the purpose of regulating metabolic stores (Rosenbaum et al., 2001). Thus the lower levels of LEP are consistent with the other changes observed in HG including reduced body fat stores, and decreased INS and Cort concentrations.
PARÁGRAFO: Our previous studies and findings in this study suggest regulatory mechanisms outside of the endocrine system are causing the alterations to the normal maternal homeorhetic response to lactation in the hypergravity environment. Homeorhetic adaptations are time dependent changes in metabolism to establish a new physiological state, such as pregnancy or lactation. Likewise the ability of animals to adapt to changes in their environment including photoperiod, heat, stress, gravity and nutrition also require time-dependent integrative homeorhetic regulation (D.E. Bauman, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, personal communication). Recently, we put forth the hypothesis that during the periparturient period, the circadian system mediates homeorhetic adaptations to lactation (Casey et al., 2009). We envision that during this period the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei integrates environmental and physiological cues that it receives. In turn, the central clock responds to these cues and coordinates behavioral and physiological changes across the dams by sending humoral and neural signals to multiple tissues, which stimulate changes in core molecular clocks of peripheral tissues including endocrine glands, mammary, and liver. Changes to the core clocks in turn effectively change the proteome and metabolome of the dam to support lactation. In addition, it is probable that the dam's capacity to produce milk and cope with metabolic stress during lactation is related to her ability to set circadian rhythms.
PARÁGRAFO: Chronic exposure to hypergravity has pronounced effects on circadian and homeostatic regulation of body temperature, activity, heart rate, and feeding (Fuller et al., 2000; Murakami and Fuller, 2000; Robinson and Fuller, 2000; Warren et al., 2000). Exposure of adult male mice to 2g hypergravity caused an immediate 4-day loss in circadian rhythm in both core body temperature and activity. Acclimation to hypergravity resulted in recovery of circadian rhythms with new, but lower, basal levels of temperature and activity (Murakami and Fuller, 2000). Similar to findings in adult male mice, our analysis of circadian behavioral data revealed hypergravity exposed pregnant females spent the first 5 days acclimating to the environment and were in a state of hypoactivity during the dark, but not the light phase of the cycle. However, in late pregnancy, day 20 and 21, HG dams became hyperactive relative control dams, suggesting that impact of gravity load on circadian behavior was dependent on physiological state of dams.
PARÁGRAFO: Offspring of homozygous female Clock mutant mice, which have a genetic mutation that disrupts circadian rhythms, fail to thrive. Clock mutant dams are deficient nest builders and exhibited disrupted nursing. Pup mortality is increased and growth rates slowed in litters of Clock mutant dams compared to wild-type dams, suggesting that milk production of the Clock mutant is not adequate enough to nourish offspring (Dolatshad et al., 2006). Our findings derived from HG dams reveal some major parallels with Clock mutant dams. First, there was a dampening of circadian cyclicity in overall activity beginning 24 h after HG exposure. Second, HG dams had lower nursing bout durations coupled with greater numbers of nursing bouts, and an aberrant pattern of digging/nest-building activity. Third, offspring body weights lagged in the HG condition and pup mortality was significantly increased. Finally post-weaning obesity has been reported in Clock offspring (Turek et al., 2005), and we previously reported significantly elevated body weights in post-weaning rats reared during HG exposure (Baer et al., 2005). Collectively, these findings provide initial support for the hypothesis that disruptions in the circadian timing system underlie the reported gravity-related changes in maternal behavior and offspring development.
PARÁGRAFO: Examination of differences in expression of core clock genes and genes that regulate molecular clocks in mammary and liver, suggest that hypergravity exposure impacted molecular clocks that generate circadian rhythms. Since data were only available for one time-point on each day, it is not known how circadian rhythms were affected by hypergravity, and thus observed differences between treatments may be indicative of changes in rhythm amplitude, phase or period. Differences in endocrine milieu in hypergravity treated dams may also be indicative of changes in the circadian system. Exposure to microgravity causes shifts in circadian rhythms and increases basal levels of cortisol in humans and rodents (Grigoriev et al., 1987; Dijk et al., 2001; Macho et al., 2001b; Macho et al., 2001a). Preflight circadian adaptation countermeasures revealed that altered lighting schedules during spaceflight caused phase shifts in plasma hormone rhythms; however, changes in basal cortisol levels were a result of alterations in gravity load (Czeisler et al., 1991; Whitson et al., 1995). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that changes in basal cortisol due to changes in gravitational force are analogous, but distinct, from the circadian system mediated seasonal changes in hormone levels that are governed by changes in photoperiod length (Lincoln and Richardson, 1998; Dardente, 2007; Ebling and Barrett, 2008; Nakao et al., 2008), and may quite possibly be mediated through a hypothalmic-vestibular connection (Fuller et al., 2002; Murakami et al., 2002).
PARÁGRAFO: Endogenous clocks enable organisms to anticipate periodic changes in the environment and to adapt their physiology accordingly. The transition from pregnancy to lactation represents a major physiological change requiring coordinated adjustments in physiology and metabolism to support milk production. Previous studies from our lab revealed that changes in molecular clocks are coordinated among multiple tissues during the transition from pregnancy to lactation, and suggest that the circadian system may be important in coordinating the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain lactation. Homeorhetic adaptations to lactation can be affected by physiological and environmental factors. Photoperiod is an example of an environmental factor that affects energy balance, reproduction and lactation (Dahl et al., 2000; Lincoln et al., 2006; Duncan, 2007; Dardente et al., 2010; Silveyra et al., 2010). Photoperiodic information is received and integrated across the circadian system, which effectively coordinates the animal's physiology and metabolome to photoperiod length, including seasonal changes in milk quality and quantity. Similarly, we propose that hypergravity induced alterations in homeorhetic adaptations to lactation including changes in dam metabolic capacity and behavior are due to the impact of increased gravity load on circadian clocks. Changes in circadian clocks affect output of multiple organs resulting in reduced quality and quantity of milk and therefore decreased pup survival in the hypergravity environment.
PARÁGRAFO: All animal procedures were approved by the NASA Ames Research Center IACUC. Sixty-four time-bred female Sprague-Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus; Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA), weighing between 190–280g, were used. Animals were assigned to one of five stages (n = 16 per group) corresponding to different time-points across the periparturient period. These were: G20, G21, P0 (birth), P1 (onset of lactation) and P3 (lactation day 3). During the period G2–G6, the dams were individually housed in maternity cages (47cm ×26cm ×21cm) lined with corncob bedding and maintained under standard colony conditions (12∶12 light/dark cycle [0600∶1800]; 21±1°C at 30–50% humidity). On G7, the dams were housed in custom designed metabolic cages allowing for the clean separation of urine and feces for collection and analysis. Standard rat chow (Purina #5012, pellets in maternity cages and powdered in metabolic cages) and water were available ad libitum. On G9, dams were assigned to the either hypergravity (HG) (n = 8) or control (n = 8) conditions with body weights matched across groups. Hypergravity (HG) dams were placed on the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) 24 ft centrifuge and exposed to continuous 2-g (20.1 rpm). The centrifuge was stopped daily (approximately 1h duration) for animal maintenance, veterinary inspection and data collection. Control dams were housed in the metabolic cages in the same room as the experimental dams. Both groups were therefore exposed to identical environmental conditions (light, sound, temperature, and humidity). On G21, the day prior to birth, dams were transferred from metabolic cages to standard maternity cages. Real time videography onboard the rotating centrifuge was used to identify the precise time of birth for each dam. For the P0 group, the centrifuge was briefly (<15 min) stopped three times per day at eight hr intervals to retrieve dams that were undergoing labor contractions or birth. For the P1 group, animals were retrieved within 18 to 36 h following birth. In polytocous species, milk yield and body weight gain per pup are inversely related to litter size (Kumaresan et al., 1967). Therefore, on P1, HG and control litters were yoked and their sizes adjusted so that numbers and genders of pups comprising each litter were matched across conditions. Litter size was further adjusted daily by noting the numbers of dead or missing neonates in HG litters, and then removing the equivalent number of offspring from the corresponding control litter. Gender composition of the matched HG litter was preserved in litter adjustments. Animals were euthanized at the same time of day in both groups to account for circadian variations.
PARÁGRAFO: Dams in each condition were weighed daily throughout the study. Dam body composition was analyzed using TOBEC® (Total Body Electrical Conductivity) instrumentation (EM-SCAN Inc., Springfield, IL, USA) just prior to euthanasia. Briefly, the TOBEC® instrument measures energy absorption in the presence of a radio-frequency electromagnetic field, calibrated to match the response of a conductivity sensing element. Energy absorption is increased in conductive materials (i.e., hydrated, lean tissue) as compared to highly resistive materials (i.e., fur, body fat) (Harrison and Van Itallie, 1982; Bracco et al., 1983; Presta et al., 1983). Following euthanasia of the dams, selected organ weights were measured.
PARÁGRAFO: Fetuses in the G20 and G21 age groups were surgically delivered from anesthetized dams. Neonatal rats in the P0, P1 and P3 conditions underwent vaginal delivery on G22 or 23. Pup survival was determined by counting the total number of pups at the time of birth and again during subsequent centrifuge stops. Body mass and crown-rump length (CRL) were measured at each perinatal age. Placental mass was measured on G20 and G21.
PARÁGRAFO: Housing enclosures were configured for high-resolution video recording, including red illumination to permit recording during the dark phase of the circadian cycle. Beginning on G22, HG-exposed and control dams were continuously videotaped using a 24h timelapse (12∶1 record:playback ratio) system. During playback of the videotapes, detailed analyses of overall activity, self-grooming, eating and drinking, tail chasing, digging and nest building, licking pups, retrieving pups and ingesting carcasses of moribund and/or dead pups using a time locked computer analysis system according to Ronca et al. (Ronca et al., 2001).
PARÁGRAFO: Blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture from the anesthetized dams, and plasma was prepared and immediately frozen for later analysis. In order to establish basal hormonal levels, dams were removed from their pups 2h prior to anesthesia. Commercially available radioimmunoassay and ELISA kits were used for measurement of plasma concentrations of PRL, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH; both from Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA), triiodothryronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) (Diagnostic Products, Los Angeles, CA, USA), and corticosterone (Cort, Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA). INS and leptin (LEP) levels were determined using kits from Linco Research (Irvine, CA, USA). Blood glucose, cholesterol, total protein and triglyceride levels were measured using the Dade Behring Dimension® XpandT Clinical Chemistry System (Dade Behring, Newark DE, USA).
PARÁGRAFO: At each experimental time-point, mammary gland #4, liver and abdominal adipose tissues were collected from anesthetized dams. Mammary and liver tissues were kept on ice in tris sucrose and adipose tissue was kept at 37°C in a saline solution until processing. Tissues were sliced into 0.5 mm sections with a hand-held Stadie Riggs microtome. Sliced sections weighing 100–180 mg were used immediately to measure glucose metabolism in vitro. Remaining tissue was immersed in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for later isolation of total RNA. To determine metabolic rate, tissues were placed in stoppered flasks containing Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer with 10mM glucose, 1μg/ml INS and 1μCi/flask of uniformly labeled [14C]-glucose to measure the rate of glucose oxidation to CO2 and incorporation into lipids (Bauman et al., 1970; Plaut et al., 2003). Adipose, liver and mammary tissues were incubated for 2, 3, and 4 h, respectively.
PARÁGRAFO: During lactation (P1 and P3), adipose tissue lipolysis was measured. Therefore, glycerol release, rather than glucose incorporation into lipids, was measured. Adipose slices were placed in Krebs-Ringer Buffer in the absence of INS and incubated for 2 h. Media and tissue were collected and frozen. Glycerol released into media was measured using an enzymatic assay (R-Biopharm, Inc., Cat. No.: E 0148 270) with modifications described by McNamara and Hillers (McNamara and Hillers, 1986).
PARÁGRAFO: The method used to measure metabolic rate has been previously described and validated to confirm that values represent actual mammary tissue metabolism (Bauman et al., 1970; Bauman et al., 1973; Plaut et al., 1999b; Plaut et al., 2003). Preliminary studies were also performed to validate metabolic rate measures in liver and adipose tissue. Optimal buffer choice, tris-sucrose or saline, and the temperature at which to hold the tissues (4°C, 37°C) prior to the assay were also determined. Optimal incubation time for these two tissues was determined by comparing metabolic rates following 1, 2, 3 or 4h of incubation. As shown by Etherton and Allen (Etherton and Allen, 1980), it was necessary to keep adipose tissue warm (37°C) in a saline solution prior to assay to prevent tissue hardening and death. Adipose tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 2h of incubation. Activity reached a plateau and then began to decline after 2–3h. Therefore, optimal measures of adipose tissue metabolism were obtained after 2 h of incubation. Optimal buffer and holding temperature for liver prior to assay were determined to be tris-sucrose buffer on ice. Liver tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 4–5h of incubation, thus liver tissue was incubated for 4h to measure metabolism. In addition, numerous studies utilizing metabolic assays to study toxicology and drug metabolism have determined that liver slices incubated for at least 4h and up to 20h remain viable during this time (Smith et al., 1985; Dogterom, 1993; Ekins, 1996; de Graaf et al., 2000; Maas et al., 2000; de Graaf et al., 2002).
PARÁGRAFO: Total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissue collected from G20 and P1 HG-treated and control dams and used to analyze gene expression of lipid metabolic enzymes and hormone receptors using RTq-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from frozen mammary, liver and adipose tissue using Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Samples were DNase treated using the DNA-freeTM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Total RNA was extracted from frozen visceral adipose tissue and DNase treated using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) following manufacturer's suggested protocol. Quantity and quality of the RNA was assessed with the Nanodrop® ND-1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) and on the Nanochip using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), respectively. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the GeneAmp® kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). RT-qPCR analysis was performed using the ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems) and a unique TaqMan® Assays-on-DemandTM Gene Expression kit (Applied Biosystems) specific for rat: ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) (Rn00566411_m1), acetyl co-A carboxylase (Acaca) (Rn00573474_m1), fatty acid synthetase (Fasn) (Rn00589037_m1), lipoprotein lyase (Lpl; Rn00561482_m1), glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1; Rn00561369_m1), prolactin receptor (Prlr; Rn00561795_m1), aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl; Rn00577590_m1), RAR-related orphan receptor A (Rora; Rn01173769_m1), Neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2 (Npas2; Rn01438223_m1), basic helix-loop-helix family, member e40 (Bhlhe40; Rn00584155_m1), Casein kinase I isoform epsilon (Csnk1e; Rn00581130_m1), nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (Nr1d1; Rn00595671_m1), and beta-2microglobulin (B2m; Rn00560865_m1) and beta-actin (Actb; Rn00667869_m1), which were used as the reference genes. Relative gene expression (RQ) was calculated according to the following equations: ΔCT (individual animal)  =  CT (target gene) − CT (reference gene); ΔΔCT (individual animal)  =  ΔCT (individual animal) − ΔCT (mean G20 stationary control); relative expression (RQ)  = 2−ΔΔCT.
PARÁGRAFO: Throughout the experiments, parametric data were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with gravity, day and gravity × day as main effects with the minimal level of significance set at p<0.05. Original means and standard error of mean (SEM) were used for presentation of results and discussion.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: DNA methylation (addition of methyl groups to cytosines) and changes in telomere length (TTAGGG repeats on the ends of chromosomes) are two molecular modifications that result from stress and could contribute to the long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to maternal stress on offspring behavior. Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation (Bdnf IV) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for astronauts. However, how male and female muscle may respond differently to micro- and partial-gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy after long term exposure to micro and partial gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fisher rats (n = 120) underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. After two weeks recovery, animals were divided into microgravity (0g), partial-gravity (40% of weight bearing, 0.4g), or full weight bearing (1g) interventions for 28 days. Measurements of muscle size and strength were evaluated prior to and after interventions. At 0g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle size compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Additionally, at 0.4g, females lost more dorsiflexion strength, plantar flexion strength, and other metrics of muscle strength compared to males; castration/ovariectomy did not influence these differences. Females have greater musculoskeletal aberrations during exposure to both microgravity and partial-gravity environments; these differences are not dependent on the presence of sex steroid hormones. Correspondingly, additional interventions may be necessary to mitigate musculoskeletal loss in female astronauts to protect occupational and overall health.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Previous publications have shown that BRI1 EMS suppressor 1 (BES1), a positive regulator of the brassinosteroid (BR) signalling pathway, enhances cell divisions in the quiescent centre (QC) and stimulates columella stem cell differentiation. Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1. In addition, BR and its BZR1-mediated signalling pathway are shown to alter the expression/subcellular distribution of pin-formed (PINs), which may result in changes in auxin movement. BR promotes intense nuclear accumulation of BZR1 in the root tip area, and the binding of BZR1 to the promoters of several root development-regulating genes, modulating their expression in the root stem cell niche area. These BZR1-mediated signalling cascades may account for both the ectopic activation of QC cell divisions as well as the suppression of the columella stem cell differentiation. They could also inhibit auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation by antagonizing the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BZR1-/BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways show differential effects on the maintenance of root apical meristem activities: they stimulate ectopic QC division while they show opposite effects on the differentiation of distal columella stem cells in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: To understand the early signaling steps in the response of plant cells to increased environmental temperature, 2-D difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the proteins in microsomes of Arabidopsis seedlings that are regulated early during heat stress. Using mass spectrometry, 19 microsomal proteins that showed an altered expression level within 5 min after heat treatment were identified. Among these proteins, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was one of those up-regulated rapidly after heat-shock treatment. Functional studies show loss-of-function mutants for AtANN1 and its close homolog AtANN2 were more sensitive to heat-shock treatment, whereas plants overexpressing AtANN1 showed more resistance to this treatment. Correspondingly, the heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and heat-shock factors is inhibited in ann1/ann2 double mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) is greatly impaired in the ann1 mutant and almost undetectable in ann1/ann2 double mutant. Taken together these results suggest that AtANN1 is important in regulating the heat-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt and in the response of Arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress.

PARÁGRAFO: A previous study has demonstrated that the treatment of Arabidopsis plants with chemical inhibitors of apyrase enzymes increases their sensitivity to herbicides. In this study, we found that the addition of the same or related apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of different fungicides to inhibit the growth of five different pathogenic fungi in plate growth assays. The growth of all five fungi was partially inhibited by three commonly used fungicides: copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole. However, when these fungicides were individually tested in combination with any one of four different apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 or AI.15), their potency to inhibit the growth of five fungal pathogens was increased significantly relative to their application alone. The apyrase inhibitors were most effective in potentiating the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit fungal growth, and least effective in combination with propiconazole. Among the five pathogens assayed, that most sensitive to the fungicide‐potentiating effects of the inhibitors was Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Overall, among the 60 treatment combinations tested (five pathogens, four apyrase inhibitors, three fungicides), the addition of apyrase inhibitors increased significantly the sensitivity of fungi to the fungicide treatments in 53 of the combinations. Consistent with their predicted mode of action, inhibitors AI.1, AI.10 and AI.13 each increased the level of propiconazole retained in one of the fungi, suggesting that they could partially block the ability of efflux transporters to remove propiconazole from these fungi.
PARÁGRAFO: Keywords: ABC transporters, copper octanoate, myclobutanil, plant pathogens, propiconazole
PARÁGRAFO: Fungal pathogens cause devastating losses of crops and postharvest fruits worldwide (Chen et al., 2008). Many chemical fungicides have been used in high doses and frequent intervals to prevent these losses by killing different fungal species. The global market for fungicides was estimated to be over $7.4 billion in 2005 (Morton and Staub, 2008) and is expected to rise to over $20 billion by 2017 (Israel, 2013). To reduce the risk of crop disease and enhance the safety of food, new effective fungicides or strategies to increase the potency of current fungicides need to be developed.
PARÁGRAFO: One limitation to the potency of fungicides is their rapid detoxification by fungi via their sequestration or export across the plasma membrane. Fungi use diverse cellular mechanisms for the export of xenobiotics. ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, together with major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters, are the most extensively studied families of transporters involved in fungal efflux mechanisms (Perlin et al., 2014). ABC and MFS multidrug transporters promote fungicide resistance in plant‐pathogenic fungi. In the grey mould Botrytis cinerea, the ABC transporter BcatrD acts synergistically with the MFS transporter Bcmfs1 to mediate sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide resistance (Hayashi et al., 2001, 2002). In addition, in B. cinerea, an ABC transporter is important for the detoxification of the plant fungitoxin camalexin, which is secreted by Arabidopsis in response to abiotic and biotic stress (Stefanato et al., 2009). Further, an ABC transporter (BcatrB) in B. cinerea is up‐regulated by treatment with the grapevine phytoalexin resveratrol and the fungicide fenpiclonil (Schoonbeek et al., 2001). Consistent with these findings, a B. cinerea ABC transporter mutant (ΔBcatrB) shows increased sensitivity to resveratrol and fenpiclonil during its infection of grapevine, suggesting that BcatrB provides protection against the activity of plant defence compounds and fungicides in B. cinerea. Chemical agents that inhibit the activity of ABC transporters help prevent the disease caused by growth of the pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola on wheat seedlings, although these agents do not synergize the effectiveness of the fungicide cyproconazole (Roohparvar et al., 2007). More recently, another fungal ABC transporter protein has been shown to play a role in providing resistance to fungicides in Clonostchys rosea (Dubey et al., 2014).
PARÁGRAFO: Any inhibition of the fungal toxin efflux mechanism would increase the potency of fungicides. For example, in the citrus green mould Penicillium digitatum, disruption of the ABC transporter gene PMRI causes a loss of DMI resistance. The effect of blocking transporter activity on fungal resistance to fungicides was also explored by Reimann and Deising (2005). They used confocal fluorescence microscopy with Hoechst 33342 and ethidium bromide stains to indirectly evaluate the resistance of fungi to the fungicide azoxystrobin after the application of a transport inhibitor. They first documented that plasma membrane‐associated fluorescence in stained Pyrenophora tritici‐repentis results from energy‐dependent efflux transporter activity. Then, they found that the addition of the NG5‐13a transporter inhibitor eliminated plasma membrane‐associated fluorescence. The addition of this compound to fungicides allowed chemical control of fungicide‐resistant isolates of the wheat fungal pathogen. These results provide indirect evidence that efflux transporters contribute to fungicide resistance in P. tritici‐repentis. Other authors have also noted that ABC transporters play a key role in aiding the resistance of pathogenic fungi to fungicides by exporting fungicides (e.g. Coleman and Mylonakis, 2009; Kretschmer et al., 2009; Perlin et al., 2014; Sang et al., 2015).
PARÁGRAFO: Plants also detoxify xenobiotics by exporting them, and a previous report has documented that overexpression of either an ABCB1 homologue (AtPgp1) or an apyrase (NTPDase) enzyme (AtAPY1) confers multiherbicide resistance to Arabidopsis thaliana plants (Windsor et al., 2003). Furthermore, inhibitors of apyrase enzyme activity suppress the ability of plants to export herbicides and thus increase their sensitivity to these toxins (Windsor et al., 2003). Consistent with these findings are the results of Liu et al. (2012), who showed that genetic suppression of apyrase expression decreased the transport of the growth hormone auxin, a process known to be dependent on the activity of ABCB transporters (Peer et al., 2011). A key function of certain apyrases is to help maintain a low steady state of extracellular ATP (eATP) (Knowles, 2011; Lim et al., 2014), which is a known regulator of diverse responses in plants and animals (Clark et al., 2014). The blocking of apyrase expression or activity increases [eATP] (Lim et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2007), and increasing [eATP] promotes the retention of herbicides (Windsor et al., 2003) and suppresses polar auxin transport (Tang et al., 2003), implying that increased [eATP], similar to the blocking of apyrase activity, inhibits the activity of ABC transporters. Taken together, these results support a dual role for apyrases and ABC transporters in herbicide resistance and auxin transport, and indicate that disruption of apyrase activity can inhibit ABC transport activity and thus block the continued efflux of toxic compounds.
PARÁGRAFO: The ability of apyrase inhibitors to suppress the export of herbicides from plant cells by inhibiting ABCB transport activity raises the possibility that they could suppress the export of fungicides from pathogenic fungi and thus enhance the potency of fungicides. To the extent that apyrase inhibitors are as effective against fungal ABC transporters as they are against plant ABCB transporters, they could enhance the fungicidal potency of fungicides, just as they enhance the herbicidal potency of herbicides.
PARÁGRAFO: Apyrases have been well studied in animal and plant cells (Clark et al., 2014; Knowles, 2011), but have been less well characterized in plant‐pathogenic fungi (Sansom, 2012; Sansom et al., 2008). In animal and plant cells, there are both surface‐localized and Golgi‐localized apyrases (Knowles, 2011). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are only two apyrases, and both are Golgi localized, where they have been demonstrated to play roles in glycosylation processes in the Golgi lumen (Abeijon et al., 1993; Gao et al., 1999). In other fungal species, there also appear to be Golgi‐localized apyrases, based on experimental evidence, as well as on sequence analyses that predict their cellular localization. Golgi‐localized apyrases have been characterized in non‐pathogenic and pathogenic fungi, where they play an important role in secretion and cell wall processes (Herrero et al., 2002; Lopez‐Esparza et al., 2013; Uccelletti et al., 2007). However, there is also some evidence for surface‐localized ecto‐apyrase activity in human fungal pathogens (Collopy‐Junior et al., 2006; Junior et al., 2005; Kiffer‐Moreira et al., 2010).
PARÁGRAFO: In addition to apyrases, there are also fungal ectophosphatases that can hydrolyse eATP and eADP, even though their K m for these substrates is much higher than that of apyrases. Ectophosphatases have been shown to play important roles in processes of nutrition, proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, virulence and infection, and so they could affect fungal resistance to fungicides in other ways (Freitas‐Mesquita and Meyer‐Fernandes, 2014). Adhesion to host cells is the first step in the establishment of a fungal infection, and ectophosphatases may be one of the first proteins of pathogens that come into contact with host cells. Recent results have indicated that these ectophosphatase activities increase the potency of fungi to adhere to host cells (Freitas‐Mesquita and Meyer‐Fernandes, 2014).
PARÁGRAFO: The objective of this study was to determine whether or not four specific apyrase inhibitors (AI.1 [N‐(m‐tolyl)‐(1,1′‐biphenyl)‐4‐sulfonamide], AI.10 (S‐heptyl‐2‐oxo‐2H‐chromene‐3‐carbothioate), AI.13 {3‐[N‐(4‐bromophenyl)sulfamoyl]‐N‐(3‐nitrophenyl)benzamide} and AI.15 {(E)‐3‐methyl‐N′‐[1‐(naphthalen‐2‐yl)ethylidene]benzohydrazide}) enhance the potency of the commonly available fungicides to more effectively restrict the growth of several plant‐pathogenic fungal species.
PARÁGRAFO: A multiple alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that the primary structure of the apyrases from different pathogenic fungi differ in the size of their C‐terminal ends from the known plant apyrases (Fig. S1a, see Supporting Information). The apyrases of Colletotrichum graminicola and Verticillium dahliae are close to each other and lie on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree, whereas those in B. cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum lie on different branches (Fig. S1b).
PARÁGRAFO: The effects of apyrase inhibitors NGXT191 (in this study AI.1) (Clark et al., 2010a, 2010b, 2011; Windsor et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2007) and NGXT1913 (AI.13) (Clark et al., 2010a; Liu et al., 2012) on plant growth and development have been reported previously. In addition to these two apyrase inhibitors, we used two further apyrase inhibitors (AI.10 and AI.15) in this study (Fig. 1). These four apyrase inhibitors did not affect the growth of F. oxysporum by themselves at the concentrations used in this study (Fig. S2, see Supporting Information). In addition, AI.1 and AI.13 did not affect the growth of C. graminicola and V. dahlia by themselves at the concentrations used (data not shown). However, all four of these apyrase inhibitors differentially enhanced the effect of fungicides (copper octanoate, myclobutanil and propiconazole) against the five different plant‐pathogenic fungi, as judged by the plate assays used (Wang et al., 2012) and described in detail in the following sections.
PARÁGRAFO: Chemical structure, systematic names and molecular formulae of the apyrase inhibitors (AIs) used in this study.
PARÁGRAFO: The only apyrase inhibitor that showed a statistically significant effect on the ability of copper octanoate to inhibit B. cinerea fungal growth was AI.1. When AI.1 was combined with copper octanoate, it had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the growth of B. cinerea, showing 22% more growth inhibition than copper octanoate treatment alone (Fig. 2a). All four inhibitors significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of myclobutanil and propiconazole on the growth of B. cinerea (Fig. 2b,c). Inhibitor AI.10 was the least effective of the four inhibitors at potentiating the growth inhibition caused by myclobutanil and propiconazole.
PARÁGRAFO: Apyrase inhibitors differentially enhance the potency of three different fungicides [(a) copper octanoate, (b) myclobutanil and (c) propiconazole] against the pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea. The plant‐pathogenic fungal strain (B. cinerea) was grown in yeast extract–peptone–dextrose (YPD) medium in a Petri dish in the presence of 65 μm apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 and AI.15) at 30 °C for 12 days. The equivalent concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added as a control (0.05%). The experiments were repeated twice with similar results. Error bars indicate standard deviations (n = 5). For each treatment, the statistical significance of the potency of the fungicides is indicated: ***Student's t‐test, P < 0.001; **Student's t‐test, P < 0.01; *Student's t‐test, P < 0.05.
PARÁGRAFO: Inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of copper octanoate on the growth of C. graminicola, (Fig. 3a), and inhibitors AI.1, AI.13 and AI.15 significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of myclobutanil on the growth of C. graminicola (Fig. 3b). Although combining any of the four inhibitors with propiconazole resulted in a statistically significant effect on the ability of this fungicide to inhibit the growth of C. graminicola, the difference relative to propiconazole alone was not large (Fig. 3c). The most effective inhibitor at potentiating the growth inhibitory effects of each of the three fungicides on C. graminicola was AI.1.

PARÁGRAFO: Inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of copper octanoate on the growth of F. oxysporum (Figs 4 and 5a), and all four inhibitors statistically significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of myclobutanil on the growth of F. oxysporum (Figs 4 and 5b). In the presence of each of the inhibitors, the fungicide propiconazole had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the growth of F. oxysporum relative to propiconazole alone (Figs 4 and 5c).

PARÁGRAFO: Copper octanoate combined with each of the four inhibitors had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the growth of S. sclerotiorum relative to treatment with copper octanoate alone (Fig. 6a). Similarly, all four apyrase inhibitors combined with myclobutanil or propiconazole resulted in a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the growth of S. sclerotiorum relative to treatment with either of these fungicides alone (Fig. 6b,c). However, the effects of the inhibitors on the ability of propiconazole to inhibit growth were less than 10% relative to propiconazole alone.

PARÁGRAFO: Inhibitors AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 and AI.15 significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of copper octanoate on the growth of V. dahliae (Fig. 7a). All four inhibitors significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of myclobutanil on the growth of V. dahliae (Fig. 7b). In contrast, although all four inhibitors statistically significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of propiconazole on the growth of V. dahliae, this effect was not as significant (Fig. 7c).
PARÁGRAFO: Apyrase inhibitors differentially enhance the potency of three different fungicides [(a) copper octanoate, (b) myclobutanil and (c) propiconazole] against the pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae. Plant‐pathogenic fungal strain (V. dahliae) was grown in yeast extract–peptone–dextrose (YPD) medium in a Petri dish in the presence of 65 μm of apyrase inhibitors (AI.1, AI.10, AI.13 and AI.15) at 30 °C for 12 days. The equivalent volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added as a control. The experiments were repeated twice with similar results. Error bars indicate standard deviations (n = 5). For each treatment, the statistical significance of the potency of fungicides is indicated: ***Student's t‐test, P < 0. 001; **Student's t‐test, P < 0.01; *Student's t‐test, P < 0.05.
PARÁGRAFO: In order to test a postulated mechanism by which apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the ability of fungicides to inhibit fungal growth, we assayed the levels of propiconazole retained in three fungal species when only a fungicide in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent was applied relative to when the fungicide was applied with one of the apyrase inhibitors in DMSO. Treatment with AI.13 + propiconazole for 12 days resulted in a significantly higher retention of propiconazole (two‐fold) in B. cinerea compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8a). Similarly, treatment with AI.1 + propiconazole for 7 days resulted in a significantly higher level (two‐fold) of propiconazole retained in C. graminicola compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8b). Moreover, in S. sclerotiorum, treatment with AI.10 + propiconazole for 7 days resulted in an approximately two‐fold increased retention of propiconazole compared with the propiconazole/DMSO control (Fig. 8c).
PARÁGRAFO: Apyrase inhibitors differentially affect the retention of propiconazole in Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum graminicola and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum as determined by mass spectrometry. (a) Treatment with AI.13 statistically significantly increases the level of propiconazole in B. cinerea. (b) Treatment with AI.1 statistically significantly increases the level of propiconazole in C. graminicola. (c) Treatment with AI.10 statistically significantly increases the level of propiconazole in S. sclerotiorum. Error bars indicate standard deviations (n = 3). Significance of fungicide retention: **Student's t‐test, P < 0.01.
PARÁGRAFO: Apyrase activity, defined as nucleoside triphosphate‐diphosphohydrolase activity that is insensitive to inhibition by molybdate and ascorbic acid, does not hydrolyse AMP substrates and has a pH optimum near neutral (Knowles, 2011), was identified in the growth media of B. cinerea and F. oxysporum, and partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, as used to partially purify pea apyrase (Chen et al., 1987). Inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 each inhibited the apyrase activity precipitated by both 50% and 80% ammonium sulfate treatments (Fig. 9). In the enzyme preparation from B. cinerea the range of inhibition by AI.1 was 65–96%, and the range of inhibition by AI.13 was 59–65% (Fig. 9a). For F. oxysporum the range of inhibition by AI.1 was 49–50%, and the range of inhibition by AI.13 was 33–65% (Fig. 9b).
PARÁGRAFO: Apyrase inhibitors suppress the apyrase activity released by fungi into the growth medium. (a) AI.1 and AI.13 inhibit the activity of apyrase extracted from the growth medium of Botrytis cinerea that was precipitated by 50% or 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. (b) AI.1 and AI.13 inhibit the activity of apyrase extracted from the growth medium of Fusarium oxysporum that was precipitated by 50% or 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. Pi, inorganic phosphate.
PARÁGRAFO: When a fungal culture of F. oxysporum was treated with DMSO and 65 µm apyrase inhibitor AI.1, [eATP] increased over the control level at 24 h, and increased further up to 48 h. It then declined at 72 h. At 24, 48 and 72 h, the increased [eATP] was significantly higher than that of the DMSO control (Fig. S3, see Supporting Information).
PARÁGRAFO: The addition of 12 mm ATP and 2.14 mm myclobutanil to a fungal culture of B. cinerea yielded a growth inhibition area of 83 mm2, far less than the inhibition area observed for this pathogen in Fig. 2b using myclobutanil combinations with any one of the apyrase inhibitors tested. To test whether ATPγS, which is poorly hydrolysable, would be more effective than ATP, we assayed its ability to enhance the potency of copper octanoate. As shown in Fig. S4 (see Supporting Information), ATPγS was also ineffective in increasing fungicidal activity.
PARÁGRAFO: Consistent with previous reports showing that apyrase inhibitors can enhance the potency of herbicides (Thomas et al., 2000; Windsor et al., 2003), our data show that apyrase inhibitors enhance the potency of different fungicides when compared with fungicide treatment alone (Figs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7). At the concentrations used, the apyrase inhibitors tested here did not affect the growth of fungi by themselves (Fig. S2), just as, by themselves, they do not inhibit the growth of plants at concentrations that increase herbicide effectiveness. In contrast, pretreatment of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, with anti‐psychotic drugs that can inhibit ecto‐NTPDases (ecto‐apyrases) does suppress the effectiveness of this fungus in infecting rice (Long et al., 2015).
PARÁGRAFO: To address the question of whether the addition of inhibitors affects efflux mechanisms, our mass spectroscopy study showed that fungi grown with fungicides together with inhibitors retain more than two‐fold more fungicide inside their hyphae than fungi grown only with fungicides (Fig. 8), just as plants grown with herbicide–inhibitor mixtures retain more herbicide than those treated with herbicide alone (Windsor et al., 2003). Taken together these observations indicate that apyrase inhibitors function similarly in fungi as they do in higher plants, and that apyrase activity and efflux transport activity are linked in fungi as they are in plants.
PARÁGRAFO: A plausible interpretation of the fungicide retention data (Fig. 8) is that the apyrase inhibitors can reduce the activity of ATP‐driven efflux transportation of fungicides out of the hyphae of several pathogenic fungi. Because a number of different efflux transporters are probably involved in fungicide efflux in the different pathogenic fungi tested, the results are also consistent with the hypothesis that the apyrase inhibitors are active against a broad range of transporters. Alternatively, the mass spectroscopy data could be interpreted to mean that the inhibitors shift the equilibrium between uptake and efflux of the fungicide more towards uptake in these fungi, although there are no previous data to indicate that the inhibitors affect uptake mechanisms.
PARÁGRAFO: Apyrases have unique phosphatase activity and are the most potent phosphatases (have the lowest K m) for the hydrolysis of tri‐ and dinucleotides. The apyrase inhibitors used in these studies were selected in a screen which demonstrated that they were more effective against apyrases than against alkaline or acid phosphatases or luciferases (Windsor et al., 2002). One possible mechanism by which apyrase inhibitors could potentiate the effectiveness of fungicides is similar to the manner in which they have been postulated to increase herbicidal action in plants, which is by disruption of the ATP concentration gradient across the plasma membrane, resulting in a reduction in the ATP‐driven efflux activity of ABC transporters (Thomas et al., 2000; Windsor et al., 2003). In both plant and animal cells, ABC transporters can release ATP into the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Abraham et al., 1993; Thomas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2011); thus, it is possible that certain fungal ABC transporters could also efflux ATP when transporting toxins from the cell. The inhibition of apyrase activity would then be expected to increase eATP levels, and, as a result, the inside–outside ATP concentration gradient would decrease, and, according to models first published in animal systems (Abraham et al., 1993), the fungal cells would become less able to export fungicides, leading to the inhibition of growth. Although we observed that treatment with apyrase inhibitors increased [eATP] in the media in which fungi were growing (Fig. S3), simply adding ATP or ATPγS to the media with fungicides did not increase the potency of the fungicides (Fig. S4). This result is in contrast with that observed by Windsor et al. (2003) in plants, where an increase in [ATP] in the applied herbicides increased their herbicidal activity.
PARÁGRAFO: The greater effectiveness of apyrase inhibitors over the applied ATP or ATPγS in enhancing the potency of fungicides may be related to the hydrophobic character of fungal cell walls. As noted above, according to current models, the likely site of action for either apyrase inhibitors or eATP is the plasma membrane. The fungal cell wall contains lipids and waxes, and may also contain hydrophobin proteins, making it rather resistant to penetration by hydrophilic substances (Ross, 2001). Apyrase inhibitors are relatively hydrophobic and would be able to diffuse through the wall better than hydrophilic ATP or ATPγS molecules. Thus, although the inhibitors could, by blocking ecto‐apyrase activity at the plasma membrane, increase [eATP] at that site, externally applied ATP or ATPγS might be repelled at the wall surface and thus not alter significantly the gradient of ATP across the plasma membrane.
PARÁGRAFO: An alternative mechanism for inhibitor enhancement of fungicidal activity could be that the inhibitors may function to disrupt apyrase activity in the Golgi, the main subcellular site of apyrase function in yeast (Abeijon et al., 1993). The inhibitors are sufficiently hydrophobic to enter cells and interact with Golgi‐localized apyrases. Based on the known functions of apyrases in yeast, this action would be expected to block both the glycosylation of many membrane proteins, including efflux transporters, and their insertion into the plasma membrane, and both of these effects would probably diminish efflux transporter activity in the pathogenic fungi studied. The testing of this hypothesis would require the development of immunological, cytological and biochemical tools to study the locale of both apyrases and efflux transporters in pathogenic fungi and the post‐translational modification of the transporters.
PARÁGRAFO: Any discussion on the different potential modes of action of apyrase inhibitors should note their ability to inhibit other phosphatases that could be present in fungal walls or inside fungal cells. To the extent that they penetrate into cells, the inhibitors could suppress the activity of intracellular apyrases and phosphatases, and this, too, could contribute to their enhancement of fungicidal activity. Table S1 (see Supporting Information) summarizes previously published data on the relative effectiveness of the four inhibitors used in these studies in blocking the activity of apyrase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and luciferase. Although the relative specificity of the inhibitors varies, the one feature they have in common is that they are all more effective in inhibiting apyrase than any other phosphatase. Nonetheless, our data do not rule out inhibitor effects on intracellular and extracellular enzymes other than apyrase.
PARÁGRAFO: The different inhibitors used have different potencies to inhibit potato apyrase (Windsor et al., 2003, 2002), and so it was important to assay whether they inhibit equally the apyrase activities found in extracts of the different pathogens. For these experiments, apyrase activity found in the growth media for B. cinerea and F. oxysporum was used. Apyrase activity can be partially purified from crude extracts of both pea (Chen et al., 1987) and Arabidopsis (data not shown) by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and may be found in pellets precipitated by both 50% and 80% saturated ammonium sulfate. The inhibitors AI.1 and AI.13 both inhibited all the apyrase preparations tested, but were more potent against the B. cinerea apyrase than the F. oxysporum apyrase, a result consistent with our observation that the inhibitors enhanced fungicidal activity more strongly against B. cinerea than against F. oxysporum. To better document the differential effectiveness of different apyrase inhibitors against different apyrases from fungal pathogens, tests should be performed with fully purified apyrases from these pathogens.
PARÁGRAFO: With regard to their field use, apyrase inhibitors mixed with fungicides would typically be applied to seeds or to mature stages of crop growth. Thus the inhibitor–fungicide mixture would rarely be used at the same time as herbicides, which are typically applied to kill weeds at the seedling stage of crop growth. The inhibitors themselves have no negative effects on plant growth (Windsor et al., 2003), and so it is unlikely that the presence of apyrase inhibitors in fungicides when they are used on plants would have any negative effects on the plants.
PARÁGRAFO: In recent years, it has become clear that plant apyrases also play a role in biotic defence responses (Cao et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2014). The best‐studied example of plant apyrase involvement in the ability of plants to defend themselves against fungal pathogens is that of the pea ecto‐apyrase PsAPY1 (Amano et al., 2013; Shiraishi, 2013; Toyoda et al., 2012). A suppressor molecule produced by the fungal pathogen, Mycosphaerella pinodes, regulates the activity of this pea apyrase (Toyoda et al., 2012). Ectopic expression of PsAPY1 in Nicotiana increased resistance to pathogen attack (Shiraishi, 2013). Similarly, other recent findings have indicated that transient expression of a Medicago truncatula apyrase in Nicotiana benthamiana limits necrotic lesions formed in response to attack from a fungal pathogen (Toyoda et al., 2014), and an extracellular apyrase in peas plays a key role in plant defence against fungal pathogenesis before the onset of pathogen‐associated molecular pattern (PAMP)‐triggered immunity (Toyoda et al., 2016).
PARÁGRAFO: Previous data have indicated that apyrase activity is strongly linked to efflux transporter activity in plants. The most likely interpretation of the new data presented here in fungi is that this linkage is also true in fungi. Although the molecular mechanism by which apyrase inhibitors disrupt the efflux of toxins has not yet been defined, the fact that these inhibitors promote the retention of pesticides in both plants and fungi suggests that the apyrase–efflux transporter relationship has been functionally conserved in evolution. Independent of these theoretical considerations, our findings may have practical utility for the creation of advanced formulations of more potent fungicides that will aid in the control of pathogenic fungi and help to prevent devastating crop loss.
PARÁGRAFO: The plate assays reported here raise the question of whether apyrase inhibitors would enhance the potency of fungicides and provide pathogen protection to plants in glasshouse or field studies. Field trials have begun, and although not reported here, an initial study of wheat seeds infected by a mixture of pathogenic fungi, including species of Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Penicillium and Cladosporium, revealed that apyrase inhibitor AI.1 significantly enhanced the potency of tebuconazole (a close relative of propiconazole) to prevent fungal growth on the seeds. The reduction of fungal counts on the seeds treated with a mixture of tebuconazole and AI.1 was more than 50% greater than the reduction seen with tebuconazole treatment alone. These results offer promise that the apyrase inhibitors studied here may become valuable aids in efforts to reduce the heavy losses inflicted by pathogenic fungi on major crops each year.
PARÁGRAFO: The plant‐pathogenic fungal strains B. cinerea, C. graminicola, F. oxysporum, S. sclerotiorum and V. dahliae were obtained from the Institute for Plant Genomics & Biotechnology, Texas A & M University, College Station, TX, USA. Potato glucose agar (PGA, Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was routinely used for the growth of different pathogenic fungal strains.
PARÁGRAFO: Apyrase inhibitors NGXT191 (AI.1), AI.10, NGXT1913 (AI.13) and AI.15 were used in this study. The fungicides copper octanoate (C16H30CuO4), myclobutanil (C15H17ClN4) and propiconazole (C15H17Cl2N3O2) were used. The concentrations of these compounds were as follows: copper octanoate, 285 mm; myclobutanil, 2.14 mm; propiconazole, 4.64 mm.
PARÁGRAFO: Standard antifungal susceptibility disc tests were performed to determine any potentiating effect of apyrase inhibitors on the growth of the pathogenic fungi. Wild‐type strains of the pathogenic fungi were plated on PGA medium (pH 5.6) with Whatman paper discs containing fungicides at the centre of the plate. Plates containing either apyrase inhibitors (65 μm) or an equal concentration of DMSO solvent (0.05%) served as experimental controls, and when either was applied alone, it did not affect the growth of pathogenic fungi. Plates were incubated at 30 ºC for 7 days (C. graminicola and S. sclerotiorum) or 12 days (B. cinerea, F. oxysporum and V. dahliae), depending on the growth rate of the fungi. Plates were photographed, and the zone of fungal growth inhibition was measured using Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). All the tests were performed with five replicates. The experiments were performed twice. Results were analysed for statistical significance using Student's t‐tests.
PARÁGRAFO: After fungicide treatment, both the DMSO control and the apyrase inhibitor‐grown tissue were collected and washed twice with 1 mL of potato dextrose liquid medium (pH 5.6) at 3000 g for 5 min. The tissue was frozen with liquid N2 and homogenized with a homogenizer with 0.3 mL of 85% methanol. It was then centrifuged at 9000 g for 10 min at 4 ºC. The supernatant was collected and protein was quantified using a Direct Detect® Spectrometer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
PARÁGRAFO: For mass spectrometry quantification, the D5 propiconazole (C15H12Cl2N3O2D5) standard was obtained from Analytical Standard Solutions (A2S), Saint Jean d'Illac, France as a 10‐ppm solution in acetonitrile (C2H3N). An 8‐µL aliquot of each sample was injected with 0.3 µL of the 10‐ppm standard. For propiconazole analysis, solvent B was acetonitrile and solvent A was water. The liquid chromatography (LC) program was a linear gradient from 5% B to 95% B over 4 min, followed by a 4‐min hold at 95% B. The ionization source was an Agilent Jet Stream (Santa Clara, CA, USA) source in positive mode Electrospray ionization (ESI) with a drying gas temperature of 350 ºC, drying gas flow of 13 L/min, sheath gas temperature of 350 ºC, nebulizer pressure of 40 psi, V cap of 2900 V, nozzle voltage of 1500 V, fragmenter voltage of 150 V and skimmer voltage of 65 V. The column was a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 µm) with a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 narrow‐bore guard column (12.5 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 µm).
PARÁGRAFO: Each sample was run in triplicate. The target (C15H17Cl2N3O2) and D5 standard (C15H12Cl2N3O2D5) eluted at 4.3 min and were observed as [M + H]+ and [M – Cl]+ ions. The areas of the extracted ion chromatograms for propiconazole ([C15H17Cl2N3O2 + H]+ at 342 and [C15H17Cl2N3O2 – Cl]+ at 306) and the D5 standard ([C15H12D5Cl2N3O2 + H]+ at 347 and [C15H12D5Cl2N3O2 – Cl]+ at 311) were found, and the ratio of the areas was determined. The area value was divided by the protein value to calculate the final amount of propiconazole inside the propiconazole‐ and propiconazole + apyrase inhibitor‐treated fungus.
PARÁGRAFO: The plant‐pathogenic fungus F. oxysporum was inoculated on 5 mL of potato dextrose broth (pH 5.6) containing apyrase inhibitor AI.1 (65 µm). DMSO (0.05%) served as an experimental control. The liquid culture was kept at 30 °C with constant shaking at 200 rpm for the indicated number of days. Two hours before media collection, the tubes were removed from the shaker and kept still. Three individual samples of 50 µL of medium were removed from each tube and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored at −80 °C until ATP measurements were made. The [ATP] in the growth media was determined using the ENLITEN ATP Assay System from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) according to the method of Lim et al. (2014). In all cases, three biological replicates and three technical replicates were included in the average.
PARÁGRAFO: Fusarium oxysporum and B. cinerea were grown in potato dextrose medium for 48 h. Cultures were centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min to pellet down the fungal hyphae. Clear supernatant was taken to assay the phosphatase activity in the fungal growth media. Soluble fungal proteins were precipitated at 4 ºC by the addition of solid (NH4)2SO4 until the entire solid was dissolved in the solution up to 50% saturation. After 15 min of stirring, proteins were centrifuged at 9000 g for 15 min to pellet down the precipitate. Additional (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant up to 80% saturation, and the solution was centrifuged at 9000 g for 15 min to pellet down the precipitate. After the (NH4)2SO4 precipitations, proteins from the 50% and 80% (NH4)2SO4 precipitations were separately desalted, quantified and assayed for phosphatase activity with 60 mm Hepes [4‐(2‐hydroxyethyl)‐1‐piperazineethanesulfonic acid)], 3 mm MgCl2 and a selection of one of the following conditions: 3 mm ATP, ADP or AMP nucleotide at pH 4, pH 5.6, pH 7, pH 8 or pH 9.5. Only at pH 7 were 1.12 mm ascorbic acid and 0.8 mm ammonium molybdate added to inhibit acid and alkaline phosphatases. Samples were incubated at 30 ºC at 150 rpm with or without inhibitors. In this assay, two inhibitors (AI.1 and AI.13) were dissolved in 0.05% (v/v) DMSO at 65 µm concentration. Inorganic phosphate concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of the phosphomolybdenum complex at 820 nm (Chen et al., 1956).

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Annexins are a multigene family of calcium-dependent membrane-binding proteins that play important roles in plant cell signaling. Annexins are multifunctional proteins, and their function in plants is not comprehensively understood. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) annexins ANN1 and ANN2 are 64% identical in their primary structure, and both are highly expressed in seedlings. Here, we showed that ann-mutant seedlings grown in the absence of sugar show decreased primary root growth and altered columella cells in root caps; however, these mutant defects are rescued by Suc, Glc, or Fru. In seedlings grown without sugar, significant up-regulation of photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation was found in ann-mutant cotyledons compared to that in wild type, which indicates potential sugar starvation in the roots of ann-mutant seedlings. Unexpectedly, the overall sugar content of ann-mutant primary roots was significantly higher than that of wild-type roots when grown without sugar. To examine the diffusion of sugar along the entire root to the root tip, we examined the unloading pattern of carboxyfluorescein dye and found that post-phloem sugar transport was impaired in ann-mutant root tips compared to that in wild type. Increased levels of ROS and callose were detected in the root tips of ann-mutant seedlings grown without Suc, the latter of which would restrict plasmodesmal sugar transport to root tips. Our results indicate that ANN1 and ANN2 play an important role in post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip, which in turn indirectly influences photosynthetic rates in cotyledons. This study expands our understanding of the function of annexins in plants.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Microgravity (modeled by head-tilt bedrest and hind-limb unloading), experienced during prolonged spaceflight, results in neurological consequences, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, and potentially impairment during the performance of critical tasks. Similar pathologies are observed in bedrest, sedentary lifestyle, and muscle disuse on Earth. In our previous study, we saw that head-tilt bedrest together with social isolation upregulated the milieu of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus and plasma. These changes were mitigated in a MCAT mouse model overexpressing human catalase in the mitochondria, pointing out the importance of ROS signaling in this stress response. Here, we used a head-tilt model in socially housed mice to tease out the effects of head-tilt bedrest without isolation. In order to find the underlying molecular mechanisms that provoked the cytokine response, we measured CD68, an indicator of microglial activation in the hippocampus, as well as changes in normal in-cage behavior. We hypothesized that hindlimb unloading (HU) will elicit microglial hippocampal activations, which will be mitigated in the MCAT ROS-quenching mice model. Indeed, we saw an elevation of the activated microglia CD68 marker following HU in the hippocampus, and this pathology was mitigated in MCAT mice. Additionally, we identified cytokines in the hippocampus, which had significant positive correlations with CD68 and negative correlations with exploratory behaviors, indicating a link between neuroinflammation and behavioral consequences. Unveiling a correlation between molecular and behavioral changes could reveal a biomarker indicative of these responses and could also result in a potential target for the treatment and prevention of cognitive changes following long space missions and/or muscle disuse on Earth.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In addition to muscle weakness, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with an increased incidence of skeletal fractures. The SOD1G93A mouse model recapitulates many features of human ALS. These mice also exhibit decreased bone mass. However, the functional, or biomechanical, behavior of the skeleton in SOD1G93A mice has not been investigated. To do so, we examined skeletal phenotypes in end-stage (16-week-old) SOD1G93A female mice and healthy littermate female controls (N=9–10/group). Outcomes included trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture by microcomputed tomography; stiffness and strength via three-point bending; resistance to crack growth by fracture toughness testing; and cortical bone matrix properties via cyclic reference point indentation.
PARÁGRAFO: SOD1G93A mice had similar bone size, but significantly lower trabecular bone mass (−54%), thinner trabeculae (−41%) and decreased cortical bone thickness (−17%) and cortical area (−18%) compared to control mice (all p<0.01). In line with these bone mass and microstructure deficits, SOD1G93A mice had significantly lower femoral bending stiffness (−27%) and failure moment (−41%), along with decreased fracture toughness (−18%) (all p<0.001).
PARÁGRAFO: This is the first study to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage ALS mice, and imply multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in patients in ALS. Importantly, our results provide strong rationale for interventions to reduce fracture risk in ALS patients with advanced disease.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In the near future, space agencies plan to send the first crews for extended stays on the Moon and Mars, where gravity is significantly reduced compared to Earth (0.16×g and 0.38×g, respectively). However, the long-term effects of partial gravity have not yet been elucidated, and ensuring astronauts’ health and performance is crucial to the success of these missions. Using a quadrupedal partial weight-bearing (PWB) model in rats that we designed, we investigated the longitudinal time course of muscle function at three different PWB levels. We demonstrated that both muscle mass and muscle function are significantly impaired in reduced weight-bearing environments as early as after 7 days of suspension. Moreover, we showed that muscular alterations are correlated to the PWB level and do not reach a plateau during a 1-month exposure to reduced weight-bearing, emphasizing the need for mitigating countermeasures for safe and successful extraterrestrial exploration.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) is a tool utilized in rehabilitation and injury prevention to improve muscle strength and size, particularly in load-compromised individuals. BFRT facilitates gains in muscular strength and hypertrophy at lower loads, allowing for accelerated recovery and less disuse atrophy. BFRT must be applied appropriately and with caution, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular concerns. There are applications for BFRT across a wide spectrum of human performance training and in rehabilitation of both lower and upper extremity conditions, providing a high-quality adjunct to improve muscle strength, power, and endurance.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n = 11–12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: For decades, scientists have relied on animals to understand the risks and consequences of space travel. Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the rat PWB model.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Ground‐based animal models have been used extensively to understand the effects of microgravity on various physiological systems. Among them, hindlimb suspension (HLS), developed in 1979 in rats, remains the gold‐standard and allows researchers to study the consequences of total unloading of the hind limbs while inducing a cephalic fluid shift. While this model has already brought valuable insights to space biology, few studies have directly compared functional decrements in the muscles of males and females during HLS. We exposed 28 adult Wistar rats (14 males and 14 females) to 14 days of HLS or normal loading (NL) to better assess how sex impacts disuse‐induced muscle deconditioning. Females better maintained muscle function during HLS than males, as shown by a more moderate reduction in grip strength at 7 days (males: −37.5 ± 3.1%, females: −22.4 ± 6.5%, compared to baseline), that remains stable during the second week of unloading (males: −53.3 ± 5.7%, females: −22.4 ± 5.5%, compared to day 0) while the males exhibit a steady decrease over time (effect of sex × loading p = 0.0002, effect of sex × time × loading p = 0.0099). This was further supported by analyzing the force production in response to a tetanic stimulus. Further functional analyses using force production were also shown to correspond to sex differences in relative loss of muscle mass and CSA. Moreover, our functional data were supported by histomorphometric analyzes, and we highlighted differences in relative muscle loss and CSA. Specifically, female rats seem to experience a lesser muscle deconditioning during disuse than males thus emphasizing the need for more studies that will assess male and female animals concomitantly to develop tailored, effective countermeasures for all astronauts.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Given the growing interest in human exploration of space, it is crucial to identify the effects of space conditions on biological processes. Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, we identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated microgravity- and space-exposed worms. Overall, this work provides insight into the effect of microgravity on biological systems during and after exposure.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Studying microbes at the single-cell level in space can accelerate human space exploration both via the development of novel biotechnologies and via the understanding of cellular responses to space stressors and countermeasures. High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population that grows at an accelerated rate. Desiccated PicoShells thus provide a robust method for cell preservation before and during launch, promising a simple single-cell analysis method for studying heterogeneity in microbial populations in space.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bone loss caused by ionizing radiation is a potential health concern for radiotherapy patients, radiation workers and astronauts. In animal studies, exposure to ionizing radiation increases oxidative damage in skeletal tissues, and results in an imbalance in bone remodeling initiated by increased bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Therefore, we evaluated various candidate interventions with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities (antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, dried plum) both for their ability to blunt the expression of resorption-related genes in marrow cells after irradiation with either gamma rays (photons, 2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (protons and heavy ions, 1 Gy) and to prevent bone loss. Dried plum was most effective in reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption (Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α) and also preventing later cancellous bone decrements caused by irradiation with either photons or heavy ions. Thus, dietary supplementation with DP may prevent the skeletal effects of radiation exposures either in space or on Earth.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight is a unique environment that includes at least two factors which can negatively impact skeletal health: microgravity and ionizing radiation. We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight.

PARÁGRAFO: Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

PARÁGRAFO: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a multifaceted and gradually advancing condition characterized by a complex pathogenesis. The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD. This study not only identifies potential therapeutic targets but also offers valuable insights for future drug development in the context of CKD.

PARÁGRAFO: Platelets (PLTs) are anucleate and considered incapable of nuclear functions. Contrastingly, nuclear proteins were detected in human PLTs. For most of these proteins, it is unclear if nuclear or alternatively assigned functions are performed, a question we wanted to address for nuclear assembly protein 1 like 1 (NAP1L1). Using a wide array of molecular methods, including RNAseq, co-IP, overexpression and functional assays, we explored expression pattern and functionality of NAP1L1 in PLTs, and CD34+-derived megakaryocytes (MKs). NAP1L1 is expressed in PLTs and MKs. Co-IP experiments revealed that dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT encoded protein PDC-E2, ODP2) dynamically interacts with NAP1L1. PDC-E2 is part of the mitochondrial pyruvate-dehydrogenase (PDH) multi-enzyme complex, playing a crucial role in maintaining cellular respiration, and promoting ATP-synthesis via the respiratory chain. Since altered mitochondrial function is a hallmark of infectious syndromes, we analyzed PDH activity in PLTs from septic patients demonstrating increased activity, paralleling NAP1L1 expression levels. MKs PDH activity decreased following an LPS-challenge. Furthermore, overexpression of NAP1L1 significantly altered the ability of MKs to form proplatelet extensions, diminishing thrombopoiesis. These results indicate that NAP1L1 performs in other than nucleosome-assembly functions in PTLs and MKs, binding a key mitochondrial protein as a potential chaperone, and gatekeeper, influencing PDH activity and thrombopoiesis.

PARÁGRAFO: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) was developed as a self-contained rodent habitat for shuttle flight missions that provides inhabitants with living space, food, water, ventilation, and lighting, and this study reports whether, after minimal hardware modification, the AEM could support an extended term up to 35 days for Sprague-Dawley rats and C57BL/6 female mice for use on the International Space Station. Success was evaluated based on comparison of AEM housed animals to that of vivarium housed and to normal biological ranges through various measures of animal health and well-being, including animal health evaluations, animal growth and body masses, organ masses, rodent food bar consumption, water consumption, and analysis of blood contents. The results of this study confirmed that the AEMs could support 12 adult female C57BL/6 mice for up to 35 days with self-contained RFB and water, and the AEMs could also support 5 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for 35 days with external replenishment of diet and water. This study has demonstrated the capability and flexibility of the AEM to operate for up to 35 days with minor hardware modification. Therefore, with modifications, it is possible to utilize this hardware on the International Space Station or other operational platforms to extend the space life science research use of mice and rats.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Fungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens, have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.

PARÁGRAFO: The adverse effects of microgravity exposure on mammalian physiology during spaceflight necessitate a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms to develop effective countermeasures. One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6 J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.

PARÁGRAFO: Evidence from the International Space Station suggests microbial populations are rapidly adapting to the spacecraft environment; however, the mechanism of this adaptation is not understood. Bacteriophages are prolific mediators of bacterial adaptation on Earth. Here we survey 245 genomes sequenced from bacterial strains isolated on the International Space Station for dormant (lysogenic) bacteriophages. Our analysis indicates phage-associated genes are significantly different between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. In addition, we identify 283 complete prophages, those that could initiate bacterial lysis and infect additional hosts, of which 21% are novel. These prophage regions encode functions that correlate with increased persistence in extreme environments, such as spaceflight, to include antimicrobial resistance and virulence, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. Our results correlate microbial adaptation in spaceflight to bacteriophage-encoded functions that may impact human health in spaceflight.

PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight and terrestrial spaceflight analogs can alter immune phenotypes. Macrophages are important immune cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems and participate in immunoregulatory processes of homeostasis. Furthermore, macrophages are critically involved in initiating immunity, defending against injury and infection, and are also involved in immune resolution and wound healing. Heterogeneous populations of macrophage-type cells reside in many tissues and cause a variety of tissue-specific effects through direct or indirect interactions with other physiological systems, including the nervous and endocrine systems. It is vital to understand how macrophages respond to the unique environment of space to safeguard crew members with appropriate countermeasures for future missions in low Earth orbit and beyond. This review highlights current literature on macrophage responses to spaceflight and spaceflight analogs.

PARÁGRAFO: Whether terrestrial life can withstand the martian environment is of paramount interest for planetary protection measures and space exploration. To understand microbial survival potential in Mars-like conditions, several fungal and bacterial samples were launched in September 2019 on a large NASA scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (∼38 km altitude) where radiation levels resembled values at the equatorial Mars surface. Fungal spores of Aspergillus niger and bacterial cells of Salinisphaera shabanensis, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 were launched inside the MARSBOx (Microbes in Atmosphere for Radiation, Survival, and Biological Outcomes Experiment) payload filled with an artificial martian atmosphere and pressure throughout the mission profile. The dried microorganisms were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation (UV dose = 1148 kJ m−2) or were shielded from radiation. After the 5-h stratospheric exposure, samples were assayed for survival and metabolic changes. Spores from the fungus A. niger and cells from the Gram-(–) bacterium S. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 2- and 4-log reduction, respectively. Exposed Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was completely inactivated (both with and without UV exposure) and S. capitis subsp. capitis only survived the UV shielded experimental condition (3-log reduction). Our results underscore a wide variation in survival phenotypes of spacecraft associated microorganisms and support the hypothesis that pigmented fungi may be resistant to the martian surface if inadvertently delivered by spacecraft missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ). To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae, not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To our knowledge this is the first in situ study of this scale incorporating community and corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment.

PARÁGRAFO: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the coronavirus disease that began in 2019 (COVID-19), has been responsible for 1.4 million deaths worldwide as of 13 November 2020. Because at the time of writing no vaccine is yet available, a rapid diagnostic assay is very urgently needed. Herein, we present the development of anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles for the rapid diagnosis of specific COVID-19 viral antigen or virus via a simple colorimetric change observation within a 5 minute time period. For rapid and highly sensitive identification, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) was employed using 4-aminothiophenol as a reporter molecule, which is attached to the gold nanoparticle via an Au–S bond. In the presence of COVID-19 antigen or virus particles, owing to the antigen–antibody interaction, the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation, changing color from pink to blue, which allows for the determination of the presence of antigen or virus very rapidly by the naked eye, even at concentrations of 1 nanogram (ng) per mL for COVID-19 antigen and 1000 virus particles per mL for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein pseudotyped baculovirus. Importantly, the aggregated gold nanoparticles form “hot spots” to provide very strong SERS signal enhancement from anti-spike antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticles via light–matter interactions. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation data indicate a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in “hot spot” positions when gold nanoparticles form aggregates. Using a portable Raman analyzer, our reported data demonstrate that our antibody and 4-aminothiophenol attached gold nanoparticle-based SERS probe has the capability to detect COVID-19 antigen even at a concentration of 4 picograms (pg) per mL and virus at a concentration of 18 virus particles per mL within a 5 minute time period. Using HEK293T cells, which express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), by which SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells, we show that anti-spike antibody attached gold nanoparticles have the capability to inhibit infection by the virus. Our reported data show that antibody attached gold nanoparticles bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thereby inhibiting the virus from binding to cell receptors, which stops virus infection and spread. It also has the capability to destroy the lipid membrane of the virus.

PARÁGRAFO: The emergence of double mutation delta (B.1.617.2) variants has dropped vaccine effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although COVID-19 is responsible for more than 5.4 M deaths till now, more than 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers as the immune system of the human body can control the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we report for the first time that human host defense neutrophil α-defensin HNP1 and human cathelicidin LL-37 peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells via blocking SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding with host cells’ angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Experimental data shows that due to the binding between the delta variant spike protein RBD and bioconjugate GQDs, in the presence of the delta variant spike protein, the fluorescence signal from GQDs quenched abruptly. Experimental quenching data shows a nonlinear Stern–Volmer quenching profile, which indicates multiple binding sites. Using the modified Hill equation, we have determined n = 2.6 and the effective binding affinity 9 nM, which is comparable with the ACE2–spike protein binding affinity (8 nM). Using the alpha, beta, and gamma variant spike-RBD, experimental data shows that the binding affinity for the delta B.1.617.2 variant is higher than those for the other variants. Further investigation using the HEK293T-human ACE2 cell line indicates that peptide-conjugated GQDs have the capability for completely inhibiting the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells via blocking the ACE2–spike protein binding. Experimental data shows that the inhibition efficiency for LL-37 peptide- and HNP1 peptide-attached GQDs are much higher than that of only one type of peptide-attached GQDs.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.

PARÁGRAFO: Many viruses attach to host cells by first interacting with cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains and then by engaging with specific receptor, resulting in virus entry. In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.

PARÁGRAFO: Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

PARÁGRAFO: Collection and processing of tissues to preserve space flight effects from animals after return to Earth is challenging. Specimens must be harvested with minimal time after landing to minimize postflight readaptation alterations in protein expression/translation, posttranslational modifications, and expression, as well as changes in gene expression and tissue histological degradation after euthanasia. We report the development of a widely applicable strategy for determining the window of optimal species-specific and tissue-specific posteuthanasia harvest that can be utilized to integrate into multi-investigator Biospecimen Sharing Programs. We also determined methods for ISS-compatible long-term tissue storage (10 months at −80°C) that yield recovery of high quality mRNA and protein for western analysis after sample return. Our focus was reproductive tissues. The time following euthanasia where tissues could be collected and histological integrity was maintained varied with tissue and species ranging between 1 and 3 hours. RNA quality was preserved in key reproductive tissues fixed in RNAlater up to 40 min after euthanasia. Postfixation processing was also standardized for safe shipment back to our laboratory. Our strategy can be adapted for other tissues under NASA's Biospecimen Sharing Program or similar multi-investigator tissue sharing opportunities.

PARÁGRAFO: Organismal adaptations to spaceflight have been characterized at the molecular level in model organisms, including Drosophila and C. elegans. Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment; this is of particular concern under conditions such as disuse, paralysis, and extended-duration space flight. Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk. These first observations of the multiscale effects of unloading on the adult enthesis provide new insight into the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis with increased resistance to failure.

PARÁGRAFO: Despite a wealth of data on the effects of spaceflight on tendons and bones, little is known about its effects on the interfacial tissue between these two structures, the enthesis. Mice were sent to space on three separate missions: STS-131, STS-135, and Bion-M1 to determine how spaceflight affects the composition, structure, mechanics, and gene expression of the humerus-supraspinatus and calcaneus-Achilles entheses. At the nanoscale, spaceflight resulted in decreased carbonate levels in the bone, likely due to increased remodeling, as suggested by increased expression of genes related to osteoclastogenesis (CatK, Tnfsf11) and mature osteoblasts (Col1, Osc). Tendons showed a shift in collagen fibril size towards smaller diameters that may have resulted from increased expression of genes related to collagen degradation (Mmp3, Mmp13). These nanoscale changes did not result in micro- and milliscale changes to the structure and mechanics of the enthesis. There were no changes in bone volume, trabecular structure, failure load, or stiffness with spaceflight. This lack of tissue-level change may be anatomy based, as extremities may be less sensitive to spaceflight than central locations such as vertebrae, yet results highlight that the tendon enthesis may be robust against negative effects of spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor (kitW/W-v) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kitW/W-v mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in kitW/W-v mice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovx kitW/W-v mice. However, ovx in WT and kitW/W-v mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters. In conclusion, our findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a mediator of ovx-induced osteopenia in mice.

PARÁGRAFO: The present studies investigated the cellular mechanisms for the detrimental effects of high dose whole body γ-irradiation on bone. In addition, radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation. Increased trabecular thickness and separation and reduced fractional cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following γ-irradiation with 6 Gy. To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. Marrow cell density decreased within 1 day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 3 days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14 days (30% reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation. In contrast, osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was increased by 290% (1 day, p=0.04), 1230% (3 days, p<0.0001), and 530% (14 days, p=0.003), respectively. There was a strong association between radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation −0.85, p<0.0001). An increase (p=0.004) in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter was also detected with irradiation. A priming dose of γ-radiation (0.5 mGy), previously shown to reduce mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter. Bone marrow transplantation is effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of acute exposure to high dose whole body γ-radiation on bone turnover.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum (ob/ob), and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob). Mice were maintained at 32°C (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. ob/ob mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob compared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Pair-fed ob/ob mice were lighter, had lower WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose than ob/ob mice. Similarly, femoral length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage and cancellous bone volume fraction were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice. These findings demonstrate that the skeletal abnormalities caused by leptin deficiency are markedly attenuated in morbidly obese ob/ob mice.

PARÁGRAFO: Excessive weight gain in adults is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes. Unfortunately, dieting, exercise, and pharmacological interventions have had limited long-term success in weight control and can result in detrimental side effects, including accelerating age-related cancellous bone loss. We investigated the efficacy of using hypothalamic leptin gene therapy as an alternative method for reducing weight in skeletally-mature (9-month-old) female rats and determined the impact of leptin-induced weight loss on bone mass, density, and microarchitecture, and serum biomarkers of bone turnover (CTx and osteocalcin). Rats were implanted with cannulae in the 3rd ventricle of the hypothalamus and injected with either recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding the gene for rat leptin (rAAV-Leptin, n=7) or a control vector encoding green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP, n=10) and sacrificed 18 weeks later. A baseline control group (n=7) was sacrificed at vector administration. rAAV-Leptin-treated rats lost weight (−4±2%) while rAAV-GFP-treated rats gained weight (14±2%) during the study. At study termination, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats weighed 17% less than rAAV-GFP-treated rats and had lower abdominal white adipose tissue weight (−80%), serum leptin (−77%), and serum IGF1 (−34%). Cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis, and in lumbar vertebra tended to be lower (p<0.1) in rAAV-GFP-treated rats (13.5-months-old) compared to baseline control rats (9-months-old). Significant differences in cancellous bone or biomarkers of bone turnover were not detected between rAAV-Leptin and rAAV-GFP rats. In summary, rAAV-Leptin-treated rats maintained a lower body weight compared to baseline and rAAV-GFP-treated rats with minimal effects on bone mass, density, microarchitecture, or biochemical markers of bone turnover.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight- to 10-week-old male ob/ob mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 107 particles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed high-fat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: There is often a reciprocal relationship between bone marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts, suggesting that marrow adipose tissue (MAT) antagonizes osteoblast differentiation. MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n=11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The absence of leptin results in contrasting growth pattern of appendicular and axial bone growth in ob/ob mice. Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice (p < 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (p < 0.01). Spearman’s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ERα in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ERα antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ERβ antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ERα might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions because entry of leptin into the central nervous system (CNS) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB). We performed a study in mice to model the impact of leptin production associated with different levels of adiposity on bone formation and compared the response with well-established centrally-mediated actions of the hormone on energy metabolism. Leptin was infused (0, 4, 12, 40, 140, or 400 ng/h) for 12 days into 6-week-old female ob/ob mice (n=8/group) using sc implanted osmotic pumps. Treatment resulted in a dose-associated increase in serum leptin. Bone formation parameters were increased at EC50 infusion rates of 7–17 ng/h whereas higher levels (EC50, 40–80 ng/h) were required to similarly impact indices of energy metabolism. We then analyzed gene expression in tibia and hypothalamus at dose rates of 0, 12 and 140 ng/h; the latter dose resulted in serum leptin levels similar to WT mice. Infusion with 12 ng/h leptin increased expression of genes associated with Jak/Stat signaling and bone formation in tibia with minimal effect on Jak/Stat signaling and neurotransmitters in hypothalamus. The results suggest that leptin acts peripherally to couple bone acquisition to energy availability and that limited transport across the BBB insures that the growth promoting actions of peripheral leptin are not curtailed by the hormone’s CNS-mediated anorexigenic actions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) is negatively associated with bone mass. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same precursor cells, adipocyte differentiation may occur at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. We used MAT-deficient KitW/W−v (MAT-) mice to determine if absence of MAT reduced bone loss in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice. Male MAT- and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to a baseline, control or HU group (n = 10 mice/group) within each genotype and HU groups unloaded for 2 weeks. Femurs were evaluated using micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and targeted gene profiling. MAT- mice had a greater reduction in bone volume fraction after HU than did WT mice. HU MAT- mice had elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption compared to other treatment groups as well as a unique profile of differentially expressed genes. Adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells reconstituted c-kit but not MAT in KitW/W−v mice. The MAT- WT → KitW/W−v mice lost cancellous bone following 2 weeks of HU. In summary, results from this study suggest that MAT deficiency was not protective, and was associated with exaggerated disuse-induced cancellous bone loss.

PARÁGRAFO: The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. Mrc1−/− mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1−/− mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1−/− mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1−/− mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1−/− mice compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by transfer of bone marrow cells from donors is routinely performed in immunology research and can be used to manipulate differentiation and/or function of bone cells. However, exposure to high-dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. Gamma-irradiated (9 Gy) WBB6F1 mice were engrafted with bone marrow cells (5 × 106 cells) or purified HSCs (3,000 cells) obtained from GFP transgenic mice. In vivo analysis and in vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor-derived cells. We confirmed these findings by engrafting C57Bl/6 (B6) mice with bone marrow cells or purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic mice. We next performed adoptive transfer of purified HSCs (750 cells) into WBB6F1 and radiosensitive KitW/W-v mice and evaluated the skeleton two months later. Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice that received fractionated doses of 2 × 5 Gy. Kitw/wv mice lost weight and became osteopenic after 2 × 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were negligible after 5 Gy irradiation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of wild-type cells into Kitw/wv mice restored normal Kit expression in bone marrow. Together, these findings provide strong evidence for efficient engraftment with purified HSCs after lethal TBI with minimal collateral damage to bone. This approach will be useful for investigating mechanisms by which hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Based on body weight, morbidly obese leptin-deficient ob/ob mice have less bone than expected, suggesting that leptin plays a role in the skeletal response to weight bearing. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Mice are a commonly used model to investigate aging-related bone loss but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss prior to skeletal maturity. The mechanisms mediating premature bone loss are not well established. However, our previous work in female mice suggests housing temperature is a critical factor. Premature cancellous bone loss was prevented in female C57BL/6J mice by housing the animals at thermoneutral temperature (where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss). In the present study, we determined if the protective effects of thermoneutral housing extend to males. Male C57BL/6J mice were housed at standard room temperature (22°C) or thermoneutral (32°C) conditions from 5 (rapidly growing) to 16 (slowly growing) weeks of age. Mice housed at room temperature exhibited reductions in cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis and fifth lumbar vertebra; these effects were abolished at thermoneutral conditions. Mice housed at thermoneutral temperature had higher levels of bone formation in distal femur (based on histomorphometry) and globally (serum osteocalcin), and lower global levels of bone resorption (serum C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen) compared to mice housed at room temperature. Thermoneutral housing had no impact on bone marrow adiposity but resulted in higher abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin. The overall magnitude of room temperature housing-induced cancellous bone loss did not differ between male (current study) and female (published data) mice. These findings highlight housing temperature as a critical experimental variable in studies using mice of either sex to investigate aging-related changes in bone metabolism.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Mechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.

PARÁGRAFO: Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were sacrificed aboard the International Space Station after 37 days of flight (RR-1 mission) and frozen carcasses returned to Earth. RNA was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT). Spaceflight resulted in differential expression of genes in BAT consistent with increased non-shivering thermogenesis and differential expression of genes in WAT consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and β-oxidation.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) levels are higher in distal femur metaphysis of female mice housed at thermoneutral (32°C) than in mice housed at 22°C, as are abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) mass, and serum leptin levels. We performed two experiments to explore the role of increased leptin in temperature-enhanced accrual of BMAT. First, we supplemented 6-week-old female C57BL/6J (B6) mice with leptin for 2 weeks at 10 µg/d using a subcutaneously implanted osmotic pump. Controls consisted of ad libitum (ad lib) fed mice and mice pair fed to match food intake of leptin-supplemented mice. The mice were maintained at 32°C for the duration of treatment. At necropsy, serum leptin in leptin-supplemented mice did not differ from ad lib mice, suggesting suppression of endogenous leptin production. In support, Ucp1 expression in BAT, percent body fat, and abdominal WAT mass were lower in leptin-supplemented mice. Leptin-supplemented mice also had lower BMAT and higher bone formation in distal femur metaphysis compared to the ad lib group, changes not replicated by pair-feeding. In the second experiment, BMAT response was evaluated in 6-week-old female B6 wild type (WT), leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin-treated (0.3 μg/d) ob/ob mice housed at 32°C for the 2-week duration of the treatment. Compared to mice sacrificed at baseline (22°C), BMAT increased in ob/ob mice as well as WT mice, indicating a leptin independent response to increased temperature. However, infusion of ob/ob mice with leptin, at a dose rate having negligible effects on either energy metabolism or serum leptin levels, attenuated the increase in BMAT. In summary, increased housing temperature and increased leptin have independent but opposing effects on BMAT in mice.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Mice are typically housed at temperatures well below their thermoneutral zone. When individually housed at room temperature (~22 °C) mice experience cold stress which results in cancellous bone loss and has the potential to alter the skeletal response to treatment. It is not clear if there is a threshold temperature for cold stress-induced bone loss. It is also not clear if alternative strategies for attenuating cold stress, such as group housing, influence bone accrual and turnover. This study aimed to determine how small differences in temperature (4 °C) or heat loss (individual versus group housing with nestlets) influence bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Five-week-old mice were randomized by weight to 1 of 4 treatment groups (N = 10/group): 1) baseline, 2) single housed at 22 °C, 3) single housed at 26 °C, or 4) group housed (n = 5/cage) with nestlets at 22 °C. Mice in the baseline group were sacrificed 1 week later, at 6 weeks of age. The other 3 groups of mice were maintained at their respective temperatures and housing conditions for 13 weeks until 18 weeks of age. Compared to baseline, mice single housed at room temperature had increased body weight and femur size, but dramatically decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in distal femur metaphysis. The cancellous bone loss was attenuated but not prevented in mice individually housed at 26 °C or group housed at 22 °C. In conclusion, by impacting thermogenesis or heat loss, modest differences in housing conditions could influence experimental results.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is hypothesized to serve as an expandable/contractible fat depot which functions, in part, to minimize energy requirements for sustaining optimal hematopoiesis. We investigated whether BMAT is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, WT) and BMAT-deficient WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW-v/J (KitW/W-v) mice were lethally irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in KitW/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bacteria are able to adapt and survive in harsh and changing environments through many mechanisms, with one of them being horizontal gene transfer (HGT). This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that were co-cultured with A. pittii under SMG had a significantly higher number of isolates that were now blaOXA-500- and ISAba1-positive compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the first time, increased HGT activity under SMG and the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased gene dissemination within bacterial communities.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: During space missions, astronauts are faced with a variety of challenges that are unique to spaceflight and that have been known to cause physiological changes in humans over a period of time. Several of these changes occur at the microbiome level, a complex ensemble of microbial communities residing in various anatomic sites of the human body, with a pivotal role in regulating the health and behavior of the host. The microbiome is essential for day-to-day physiological activities, and alterations in microbiome composition and function have been linked to various human diseases. For these reasons, understanding the impact of spaceflight and space conditions on the microbiome of astronauts is important to assess significant health risks that can emerge during long-term missions and to develop countermeasures. Here, we review various conditions that are caused by long-term space exploration and discuss the role of the microbiome in promoting or ameliorating these conditions, as well as space-related factors that impact microbiome composition. The topics explored pertain to microgravity, radiation, immunity, bone health, cognitive function, gender differences and pharmacomicrobiomics. Connections are made between the trifecta of spaceflight, the host and the microbiome, and the significance of these interactions for successful long-term space missions.

Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

PARÁGRAFO: Locomotion of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a key observable used in investigations ranging from behavior to neuroscience to aging. However, while the natural environment of this model organism is 3D, quantitative investigations of its locomotion have been mostly limited to 2D motion. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of how the nematode reorients itself in 3D media. We identify a unique behavioral state of C. elegans—a roll maneuver—which is an essential component of 3D locomotion in burrowing and swimming. The rolls, associated with nonzero torsion of the nematode body, result in rotation of the plane of dorsoventral body undulations about the symmetry axis of the trajectory. When combined with planar turns in a new undulation plane, the rolls allow the nematode to reorient its body in any direction, thus enabling complete exploration of 3D space. The rolls observed in swimming are much faster than the ones in burrowing; we show that this difference stems from a purely hydrodynamic enhancement mechanism and not from a gait change or an increase in the body torsion. This result demonstrates that hydrodynamic viscous forces can enhance 3D reorientation in undulatory locomotion, in contrast to known hydrodynamic hindrance of both forward motion and planar turns.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the differences in the sizes of C. elegans developmental stages to isolate embryo cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Muscle strength is a functional measure of quality of life in humans. Declines in muscle strength are manifested in diseases as well as during inactivity, aging, and space travel. With conserved muscle biology, the simple genetic model C. elegans is a high throughput platform in which to identify molecular mechanisms causing muscle strength loss and to develop interventions based on diet, exercise, and drugs. In the clinic, standardized strength measures are essential to quantitate changes in patients; however, analogous standards have not been recapitulated in the C. elegans model since force generation fluctuates based on animal behavior and locomotion. Here, we report a microfluidics-based system for strength measurement that we call ‘NemaFlex’, based on pillar deflection as the nematode crawls through a forest of pillars. We have optimized the micropillar forest design and identified robust measurement conditions that yield a measure of strength that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using a muscle contracting agent and mutants confirm that NemaFlex can reliably score muscular strength in C. elegans. Additionally, we report a scaling factor to account for animal size that is consistent with a biomechanics model and enables comparative strength studies of mutants. Taken together, our findings anchor NemaFlex for applications in genetic and drug screens, for defining molecular and cellular circuits of neuromuscular function, and for dissection of degenerative processes in disuse, aging, and disease.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Regular physical exercise is the most efficient and accessible intervention known to promote healthy aging in humans. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate system-wide exercise benefits, however, remain poorly understood, especially as applies to tissues that do not participate directly in training activity. The establishment of exercise protocols for short-lived genetic models will be critical for deciphering fundamental mechanisms of transtissue exercise benefits to healthy aging. Here we document optimization of a long-term swim exercise protocol for Caenorhabditis elegans and we demonstrate its benefits to diverse aging tissues, even if exercise occurs only during a restricted phase of adulthood. We found that multiple daily swim sessions are essential for exercise adaptation, leading to body wall muscle improvements in structural gene expression, locomotory performance, and mitochondrial morphology. Swim exercise training enhances whole-animal health parameters, such as mitochondrial respiration and midlife survival, increases functional healthspan of the pharynx and intestine, and enhances nervous system health by increasing learning ability and protecting against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease. Remarkably, swim training only during early adulthood induces long-lasting systemic benefits that in several cases are still detectable well into midlife. Our data reveal the broad impact of swim exercise in promoting extended healthspan of multiple C. elegans tissues, underscore the potency of early exercise experience to influence long-term health, and establish the foundation for exploiting the powerful advantages of this genetic model for the dissection of the exercise-dependent molecular circuitry that confers system-wide health benefits to aging adults.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Biology experiments in space seek to increase our understanding of what happens to life beyond Earth and how we can safely send life beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physiology, including decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems. Biological experiments in space are inherently challenging to implement. Development of hardware and validation of experimental conditions are critical to ensure the collection of high-quality data. The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand spaceflight-induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceflight-induced muscle decline. These experiments have used a variety of hardware configurations. Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most recent experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting C. elegans experiments onboard the International Space Station. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation, in addition to the ground-based experiment scientific validation testing. These experiences and operational solutions allow others to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans. We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased (p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated (p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2. Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In C. elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain “interkinase region” has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force generation. We designed our CRISPR-generated in-frame deletion to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In this study, we report a microfluidic device for the whole-life culture of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans that allows the scoring of animal survival and health measures. This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants (daf-2, age-1, eat-2, and daf-16) and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes (age-1 and daf-16). We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the NemaLife chip. Overall, the capacity to generate reliable lifespan and physiological data underscores the potential of the NemaLife chip to accelerate healthspan and lifespan investigations in C. elegans.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment. Collectively, these technical advances enabled the development of new microfluidics-integrated hardware for spaceflight studies in C. elegans. Finally, we report Earth-based validation studies to test this new hardware, which has led to it being flown to the International Space Station.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The model organism Caenorhabditis elegans is used in a variety of applications ranging from fundamental biological studies, to drug screening, to disease modeling, and to space-biology investigations. These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans. The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with different C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to future C. elegans investigations on the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP desirable for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in space.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Living longer without simultaneously extending years spent in good health (“health span”) is an increasing societal burden, demanding new therapeutic strategies. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) can correct disease-related mitochondrial metabolic deficiencies, and supraphysiological H2S concentrations can pro health span. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecules (mtH2S) administered across the adult life course are unknown. Using a Caenorhabditis elegans aging model, we compared untargeted H2S (NaGYY4137, 100 µM and 100 nM) and mtH2S (AP39, 100 nM) donor effects on life span, neuromuscular health span, and mitochondrial integrity. H2S donors were administered from birth or in young/middle-aged animals (day 0, 2, or 4 postadulthood). RNAi pharmacogenetic interventions and transcriptomics/network analysis explored molecular events governing mtH2S donor-mediated health span. Developmentally administered mtH2S (100 nM) improved life/health span vs. equivalent untargeted H2S doses. mtH2S preserved aging mitochondrial structure, content (citrate synthase activity) and neuromuscular strength. Knockdown of H2S metabolism enzymes and FoxO/daf-16 prevented the positive health span effects of mtH2S, whereas DCAF11/wdr-23 – Nrf2/skn-1 oxidative stress protection pathways were dispensable. Health span, but not life span, increased with all adult-onset mtH2S treatments. Adult mtH2S treatment also rejuvenated aging transcriptomes by minimizing expression declines of mitochondria and cytoskeletal components, and peroxisome metabolism hub components, under mechanistic control by the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor circuit. H2S health span extension likely acts at the mitochondrial level, the mechanisms of which dissociate from life span across adult vs. developmental treatment timings. The small mtH2S doses required for health span extension, combined with efficacy in adult animals, suggest mtH2S is a potential healthy aging therapeutic.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Background: Understanding and countering the well-established negative health consequences of spaceflight remains a primary challenge preventing safe deep space exploration. Targeted/personalized therapeutics are at the forefront of space medicine strategies, and cross-species molecular signatures now define the ‘typical’ spaceflight response. However, a lack of direct genotype–phenotype associations currently limits the robustness and, therefore, the therapeutic utility of putative mechanisms underpinning pathological changes in flight. Methods: We employed the worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a validated model of space biology, combined with ‘NemaFlex-S’ microfluidic devices for assessing animal strength production as one of the most reproducible physiological responses to spaceflight. Wild-type and dys-1 (BZ33) strains (a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) model for comparing predisposed muscle weak animals) were cultured on the International Space Station in chemically defined media before loading second-generation gravid adults into NemaFlex-S devices to assess individual animal strength. These same cultures were then frozen on orbit before returning to Earth for next-generation sequencing transcriptomic analysis. Results: Neuromuscular strength was lower in flight versus ground controls (16.6% decline, p < 0.05), with dys-1 significantly more (23% less strength, p < 0.01) affected than wild types. The transcriptional gene ontology signatures characterizing both strains of weaker animals in flight strongly corroborate previous results across species, enriched for upregulated stress response pathways and downregulated mitochondrial and cytoskeletal processes. Functional gene cluster analysis extended this to implicate decreased neuronal function, including abnormal calcium handling and acetylcholine signaling, in space-induced strength declines under the predicted control of UNC-89 and DAF-19 transcription factors. Finally, gene modules specifically altered in dys-1 animals in flight again cluster to neuronal/neuromuscular pathways, suggesting strength loss in DMD comprises a strong neuronal component that predisposes these animals to exacerbated strength loss in space. Conclusions: Highly reproducible gene signatures are strongly associated with space-induced neuromuscular strength loss across species and neuronal changes in calcium/acetylcholine signaling require further study. These results promote targeted medical efforts towards and provide an in vivo model for safely sending animals and people into deep space in the near future.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: While numerous health-beneficial interactions between host and microbiota have been identified, there is still a lack of targeted approaches for modulating these interactions. Thus, we here identify precision prebiotics that specifically modulate the abundance of a microbiome member species of interest. In the first step, we show that defining precision prebiotics by compounds that are only taken up by the target species but no other species in a community is usually not possible due to overlapping metabolic niches. Subsequently, we use metabolic modeling to identify precision prebiotics for a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome community comprising the immune-protective target species Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 and the persistent colonizer Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71. We experimentally confirm four of the predicted precision prebiotics, L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid, to specifically increase the abundance of MYb11. L-serine was further assessed in vivo, leading to an increase in MYb11 abundance also in the worm host. Overall, our findings demonstrate that metabolic modeling is an effective tool for the design of precision prebiotics as an important cornerstone for future microbiome-targeted therapies.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: In the wild, C. elegans are emersed in environments teeming with a veritable menagerie of microorganisms. The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes from C. elegans natural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple “skin microbiome.” We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. elegans surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, including Enterobacter sp. JUb101, are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others like Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 are predominantly found in the animal’s gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.

PARÁGRAFO: The advent of phylogenetic DNA microarrays and high-throughput pyrosequencing technologies has dramatically increased the resolution and accuracy of detection of distinct microbial lineages in mixed microbial assemblages. Despite an expanding array of approaches for detecting microbes in a given sample, rapid and robust means of assessing the differential viability of these cells, as a function of phylogenetic lineage, remain elusive. In this study, pre-PCR propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment was coupled with downstream pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses to better understand the frequency, diversity and distribution of viable bacteria in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms. Sample fractions not treated with PMA, which were indicative of the presence of both live and dead cells, yielded a great abundance of highly diverse bacterial pyrosequences. In contrast, only 1% to 10% of all of the pyrosequencing reads, arising from a few robust bacterial lineages, originated from sample fractions that had been pre-treated with PMA. The results of PhyloChip analyses of PMA-treated and -untreated sample fractions were in agreement with those of pyrosequencing. The viable bacterial population detected in cleanrooms devoid of spacecraft hardware was far more diverse than that observed in cleanrooms that housed mission-critical spacecraft hardware. The latter was dominated by hardy, robust organisms previously reported to survive in oligotrophic cleanroom environments. Presented here are the findings of the first ever comprehensive effort to assess the viability of cells in low-biomass environmental samples, and correlate differential viability with phylogenetic affiliation.

PARÁGRAFO: Mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis (TB) research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute infection better than LabC mice.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be affected by the distinct environment of the ISS. The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin. This report provides insight into possible molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Microbiome analyses of low-biomass samples are challenging because of contamination and inefficiencies, leading many investigators to employ low-throughput methods with minimal controls. We developed a new automated protocol, KatharoSeq (from the Greek katharos [clean]), that outperforms single-tube extractions while processing at least five times as fast. KatharoSeq incorporates positive and negative controls to reveal the whole bacterial community from inputs of as few as 50 cells and correctly identifies 90.6% (standard error, 0.013%) of the reads from 500 cells. To demonstrate the broad utility of KatharoSeq, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenome analyses of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft assembly facility (SAF; n = 192, 96), 52 rooms of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU; n = 388, 337), and an endangered-abalone-rearing facility (n = 192, 123), obtaining spatially resolved, unique microbiomes reproducible across hundreds of samples. The SAF, our primary focus, contains 32 sOTUs (sub-OTUs, defined as exact sequence matches) and their inferred variants identified by the deblur algorithm, with four (Acinetobacter lwoffii, Paracoccus marcusii, Mycobacterium sp., and Novosphingobium) being present in >75% of the samples. According to microbial spatial topography, the most abundant cleanroom contaminant, A. lwoffii, is related to human foot traffic exposure. In the NICU, we have been able to discriminate environmental exposure related to patient infectious disease, and in the abalone facility, we show that microbial communities reflect the marine environment rather than human input. Consequently, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of large-scale, low-biomass metagenomic analyses using the KatharoSeq protocol.
PARÁGRAFO: IMPORTANCE Various indoor, outdoor, and host-associated environments contain small quantities of microbial biomass and represent a niche that is often understudied because of technical constraints. Many studies that attempt to evaluate these low-biomass microbiome samples are riddled with erroneous results that are typically false positive signals obtained during the sampling process. We have investigated various low-biomass kits and methods to determine the limit of detection of these pipelines. Here we present KatharoSeq, a high-throughput protocol combining laboratory and bioinformatic methods that can differentiate a true positive signal in samples with as few as 50 to 500 cells. We demonstrate the application of this method in three unique low-biomass environments, including a SAF, a hospital NICU, and an abalone-rearing facility.

PARÁGRAFO: Secondary metabolite (SM) production in Aspergillus niger JSC-093350089, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS), is reported, along with a comparison to the experimentally established strain ATCC 1015. The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA, which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed in A. niger, which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene, pyrE, in its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The first global genomic, proteomic, and secondary metabolomic characterization of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans following growth onboard the International Space Station (ISS) is reported. The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and 3 mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism. These data provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanism of A. nidulans to spacecraft environments.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The on-going Microbial Observatory Experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be affected by the distinct environment of the ISS. The low-nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance of microbes. Proteomic characterization of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from HEPA filter debris and cupola surface of the ISS, respectively, is presented, along with a comparison to experimentally established clinical isolates Af293 and CEA10. In-depth analysis highlights variations in the proteome of both ISS-isolated strains when compared to the clinical strains. Proteins that showed increased abundance in ISS isolates were overall involved in stress responses, and carbohydrate and secondary metabolism. Among the most abundant proteins were Pst2 and ArtA involved in oxidative stress response, PdcA and AcuE responsible for ethanol fermentation and glyoxylate cycle, respectively, TpcA, TpcF, and TpcK that are part of trypacidin biosynthetic pathway, and a toxin Asp-hemolysin. This report provides insight into possible molecular adaptation of filamentous fungi to the unique ISS environment.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Two isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, ISS-F3 and ISS-F4, were cultured from the dining table on the International Space Station (ISS). Genomic analyses using EF-1α sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically different from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans. However, its effects on the health of immunocompromised humans warrant further study.
PARÁGRAFO: IMPORTANCE This is the first study to isolate and characterize F. oxysporum isolates from a built environment, as well as one that has been exposed to space. The characterization and analysis of these two genomes may have important implications for the medical, agricultural, and food industries as well as for the health of the crew who coinhabit the ISS with these strains.

PARÁGRAFO: Filamentous fungi have been associated with extreme habitats, including nuclear power plant accident sites and the International Space Station (ISS). Due to their immense adaptation and phenotypic plasticity capacities, fungi may thrive in what seems like uninhabitable niches. This study is the first report of fungal survival after exposure of monolayers of conidia to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). Conidia of several Chernobyl nuclear accident-associated and ISS-isolated strains were tested for UV-C and SMC sensitivity, which resulted in strain-dependent survival. Strains surviving exposure to SMC for 30 min, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, were further characterized for proteomic, and metabolomic changes. Differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolic processes was observed. No significant metabolome alterations were revealed. Lastly, ISSFT-021-30 conidia re-exposed to UV-C exhibited enhanced UV-C resistance when compared to the conidia of unexposed ISSFT-021.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Four strains belonging to the family of Methylobacteriaceae were isolated from different locations on the International Space Station (ISS) across two consecutive flights. Of these, three were identified as Gram-negative, rod-shaped, catalase-positive, oxidase-positive, motile bacteria, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, whereas the fourth was identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum. The sequence similarity of these three ISS strains, designated as IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, was <99.4% for 16S rRNA genes and <97.3% for gyrB gene, with the closest being Methylobacterium indicum SE2.11T. Furthermore, the multi-locus sequence analysis placed these three ISS strains in the same clade of M. indicum. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of these three ISS strains were <93% and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values were <46.4% with any described Methylobacterium species. Based on the ANI and dDDH analyses, these three ISS strains were considered as novel species belonging to the genus Methylobacterium. The three ISS strains showed 100% ANI similarity and dDDH values with each other, indicating that these three ISS strains, isolated during various flights and from different locations, belong to the same species. These three ISS strains were found to grow optimally at temperatures from 25 to 30°C, pH 6.0 to 8.0, and NaCl 0 to 1%. Phenotypically, these three ISS strains resemble M. aquaticum and M. terrae since they assimilate similar sugars as sole carbon substrate when compared to other Methylobacterium species. Fatty acid analysis showed that the major fatty acid produced by the ISS strains are C18:1−ω7c and C18:1−ω6c. The predominant quinone was ubiquinone 10, and the major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and an unidentified lipid. Therefore, based on genomic, phylogenetic, biochemical, and fatty acid analyses, strains IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, are assigned to a novel species within the genus Methylobacterium, and the name Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is IF7SW-B2T (NRRL B-65601T and LMG 32165T).

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Most natural populations are genetically diverse. Understanding how diversity is maintained and distributed across time and space can provide insights into the potential for evolution and extinction of populations. Immunogenetic diversity aids individuals and populations in resisting infectious disease, with many studies linking resistance to genes encoding adaptive immune responses, such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. The MHC is particularly important for advancing our understanding of local adaptive processes and host–parasite interactions. Here, we review the emerging work and theory exploring the geographic and temporal patterns of MHC diversity in the wild and how they are shaped by selective and demographic processes. We discuss patterns of variation along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients and place this in the context of Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories. We emphasize how MHC diversity is often lower at the edges of species distributions, particularly in high‐latitude and high‐altitude regions. We also discuss MHC diversity in natural populations facing climate change. As climate change accelerates and emerging parasites spread, reduced immunogenetic diversity could severely threaten wildlife populations, compromising their resilience and long‐term survival. We propose that including immunogenetic diversity into a larger database of environmental and parasite data would allow biologists to test hypotheses regarding host–parasite coevolution and develop effective measures for conservation.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Black fungi are a group of melanotic microfungi characterized by remarkable polyextremotolerance. Due to a broad ecological plasticity and adaptations at the cellular level, it is predicted that they may survive in a variety of extreme environments, including harsh niches on Earth and Mars, and in outer space. However, the molecular mechanisms aiding survival, especially in space, are yet to be fully elucidated. Based on these premises, the rock-inhabiting black fungus Knufia chersonesos (Wt) and its non-melanized mutant (Mut) were exposed to simulated microgravity—one of the prevalent features characterizing space conditions—by growing the cultures in high-aspect-ratio vessels (HARVs). Qualitative and quantitative proteomic analyses were performed on the mycelia and supernatant of culture medium (secretome) to assess alterations in cell physiology in response to low-shear simulated microgravity (LSSMG) and to ultimately evaluate the role of cell-wall melanization in stress survival. Differential expression was observed for proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolic processes, transport, and ribosome biogenesis and translation via ribosomal translational machinery. However, no evidence of significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for the scytalone dehydratase, enzyme involved in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene (DNH) melanin, which was found to be upregulated in the secretome of the wild type and downregulated in the mutant. Differences in protein modulation were observed between K. chersonesos Wt and Mut, with several proteins being downregulated under LSSMG in the Mut when compared to the Wt. Lastly, no major morphological alterations were observed following exposure to LSSMG. Similarly, the strains’ survivability was not negatively affected. This study is the first to characterize the response to simulated microgravity in black fungi, which might have implications on future astrobiological missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological benefits. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Space flight has many adverse effects on the physiological functions of astronauts. Certain similarities have been observed in some physiological processes of rodents and astronauts in space, although there are also differences. These similarities make rodents helpful models for initial investigations into space-induced physiological changes. This study uses a 3D-Clinostat to simulate microgravity and explores the role of microgravity in space flight-induced liver and brain abnormalities by comparing changes in the gut microbiota, serum metabolites, and the function and physiological biochemistry of liver and brain tissues between the simulated microgravity (SMG) group mice and the wild type (WT) group mice. The study, based on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, 16S sequencing technology, and non-targeted metabolomics analysis, shows that the gut tissue morphology of the SMG group mice is abnormal, and the structure of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolite profile are imbalanced. Furthermore, using PICRUST 2 technology, we have predicted the functions of the gut microbiota and serum metabolites, and the results indicate that the liver metabolism and functions (including lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and sugar metabolism, etc.) of the SMG group mice are disrupted, and the brain tissue metabolism and functions (including neurotransmitters and hormone secretion, etc.) are abnormal, suggesting a close relationship between microgravity and liver metabolic dysfunction and brain dysfunction. Additionally, the high similarity in the structure of the gut microbiota and serum metabolite profile between the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) group mice and the SMG group mice, and the physiological and biochemical differences in liver and brain tissues compared to the WT group mice, suggest that microgravity induces imbalances in the gut microbiota, which in turn triggers abnormalities in liver and brain metabolism and function. Finally, through MetaMapp analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, we found that valeric acid, a metabolite of gut microbiota, is more likely to be the key metabolite that relates to microgravity-induced gut microbiota abnormalities, disorders of amino acid and lipid metabolism, and further induced metabolic or functional disorders in the liver and brain. This study has significant practical application value for deepening the understanding of the adaptability of living organisms in the space environment.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: In an ongoing microbial tracking investigation of the International Space Station (ISS), several Sphingomonas strains were isolated. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, phylogenetic analysis identified the ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis (n = 2) and one strain isolated from the Kennedy Space Center cleanroom (used to assemble various Mars mission spacecraft components) as Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Metagenomic sequence analyses of different ISS locations identified 23 Sphingomonas species. An abundance of shotgun metagenomic reads were detected for S. sanguinis in the location from where the ISS strains were isolated. A complete metagenome-assembled genome was generated from the shotgun reads metagenome, and its comparison with the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of the ISS S. sanguinis isolates revealed that they were highly similar. In addition to the phylogeny, the WGS of these Sphingomonas strains were compared with the WGS of the type strains to elucidate genes that can potentially aid in plant growth promotion. Furthermore, the WGS comparison of these strains with the well-characterized Sphingomonas sp. LK11, an arid desert strain, identified several genes responsible for the production of phytohormones and for stress tolerance. Production of one of the phytohormones, indole-3-acetic acid, was further confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways associated with phosphate uptake, metabolism, and solubilization in soil were conserved across all the S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains tested. Furthermore, genes thought to promote plant resistance to abiotic stress, including heat/cold shock response, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance, appear to be present in these space-related S. sanguinis and S. paucimobilis strains. Characterizing these biotechnologically important microorganisms found on the ISS and harnessing their key features will aid in the development of self-sustainable long-term space missions in the future.
PARÁGRAFO: IMPORTANCE Sphingomonas is ubiquitous in nature, including the anthropogenically contaminated extreme environments. Members of the Sphingomonas genus have been identified as potential candidates for space biomining beyond earth. This study describes the isolation and identification of Sphingomonas members from the ISS, which are capable of producing the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid. Microbial production of phytohormones will help future in situ studies, grow plants beyond low earth orbit, and establish self-sustainable life support systems. Beyond phytohormone production, stable genomic elements of abiotic stress resistance, heavy metal resistance, and oxidative and osmotic stress resistance were identified, rendering the ISS Sphingomonas isolate a strong candidate for biotechnology-related applications.

PARÁGRAFO: Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens. The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The use of film media involves considerably less preparation, waste, and incubator space than conventional agar-media-based assays and has proven in past studies to provide counts of cultivable microbes similar to those of traditional agar media. Film media also have the advantage of allowing sample volumes similar to those used in pour plates and, therefore, are well-suited for cultivable microbial counts in extremely low-biomass environments such as clean rooms or space habitats, particularly where the subsequent isolation of colonies is necessary. As the preparation of film media plates relies on water cohesion/adhesion rather than manual spreading, they may have future applications in low- or microgravity settings. In this study, cultivable microbial count performance was compared between agar media and film media in three kinds of samples: food items, surfaces in built environments on Earth (homes), and on the environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Easy Plates (Kikkoman Corporation) and Petrifilm (3M) were compared with traditional agar plating for food and home surfaces, while only Easy Plates were compared with agar for ISS samples. For both food items and built environments on Earth, both types of film media performed comparably to agar media for bacterial counts, with R2 values of 0.94–0.96. Fungal counts for built-environment samples had a lower correlation between film and agar counts, with R2 values of 0.72–0.73. Samples from the ISS, which ranged from below detection to 103 CFU per 100 cm2, had R2 values of 0.80 for bacterial counts and 0.73 for fungal counts, partially due to multiple samples recording below the detection limit for agar or too numerous to count, and the growth of fungal species on R2A medium. The species compositions of isolates picked from agar vs. film media plates were similar; however, further phylogenetic analysis is needed to confirm the differential microbial diversity composition. Overall, film media such as Easy Plates and Petrifilm are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass built environments as well as for food samples, and the two brands tested in this study performed equally well.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.

TÍTULO: ABSTRACT
PARÁGRAFO: Klebsiella species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella quasipneumoniae, are opportunistic pathogens that commonly cause infections in humans. Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae, which has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneumoniae, K. aerogenes, and K. quasipneumoniae offered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health.

PARÁGRAFO: With the advent of long-term human habitation in space and on the moon, understanding how the built environment microbiome of space habitats differs from Earth habitats, and how microbes survive, proliferate and spread in space conditions, is becoming more important. The microbial tracking mission series has been monitoring the microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) for almost a decade. During this mission series, six unique strains of Gram-stain-positive bacteria, including two spore-forming and three non-spore-forming species, were isolated from the environmental surfaces of the ISS. The analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed > 99% similarities with previously described bacterial species. To further explore their phylogenetic affiliation, whole genome sequencing was undertaken. For all strains, the gyrB gene exhibited < 93% similarity with closely related species, which proved effective in categorizing these ISS strains as novel species. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values, when compared to any known bacterial species, were < 94% and <50% respectively for all species described here. Traditional biochemical tests, fatty acid profiling, polar lipid, and cell wall composition analyses were performed to generate phenotypic characterization of these ISS strains. A study of the shotgun metagenomic reads from the ISS samples, from which the novel species were isolated, showed that only 0.1% of the total reads mapped to the novel species, supporting the idea that these novel species are rare in the ISS environments. In-depth annotation of the genomes unveiled a variety of genes linked to amino acid and derivative synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, and protein metabolism. Further analysis of these ISS-isolated organisms revealed that, on average, they contain 46 genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense. The main predicted functions of these genes are: conferring resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, and enabling invasion and intracellular resistance. After conducting antiSMASH analysis, it was found that there are roughly 16 cluster types across the six strains, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters. Based on these multi-faceted taxonomic methods, it was concluded that these six ISS strains represent five novel species, which we propose to name as follows: Arthrobacter burdickii IIF3SC-B10T (= NRRL B-65660T = DSM 115933T), Leifsonia virtsii F6_8S_P_1AT (= NRRL B-65661T = DSM 115931T), Leifsonia williamsii F6_8S_P_1BT (= NRRL B-65662T = DSM 115932T), Paenibacillus vandeheii F6_3S_P_1CT (= NRRL B-65663T = DSM 115940T), and Sporosarcina highlanderae F6_3S_P_2T (= NRRL B-65664T = DSM 115943T). Identifying and characterizing the genomes and phenotypes of novel microbes found in space habitats, like those explored in this study, is integral for expanding our genomic databases of space-relevant microbes. This approach offers the only reliable method to determine species composition, track microbial dispersion, and anticipate potential threats to human health from monitoring microbes on the surfaces and equipment within space habitats. By unraveling these microbial mysteries, we take a crucial step towards ensuring the safety and success of future space missions.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In secondary metabolite biosynthesis, core synthetic genes such as polyketide synthase genes usually encode proteins that generate various backbone precursors. These precursors are modified by other tailoring enzymes to yield a large variety of different secondary metabolites. The number of core synthesis genes in a given species correlates, therefore, with the number of types of secondary metabolites the organism can produce. In our study, heterologous expression of all the A. terreus NRPS-like genes showed that two NRPS-like proteins, encoded by atmelA and apvA, release the same natural product, aspulvinone E. In hyphae this compound is converted to aspulvinones whereas in conidia it is converted to melanin. The genes are expressed in different tissues and this spatial control is probably regulated by their own specific promoters. Comparative genomics indicates that atmelA and apvA might share a same ancestral gene and the gene apvA is located in a highly conserved region in Aspergillus species that contains genes coding for life-essential proteins. Our data reveal the first case in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in which the tissue specific production of a single compound directs it into two separate pathways, producing distinct compounds with different functions. Our data also reveal that a single trans-prenyltransferase, AbpB, prenylates two substrates, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, revealing that genes outside of contiguous secondary metabolism gene clusters can modify more than one compound thereby expanding metabolite diversity. Our study raises the possibility of incorporation of spatial, cell-type specificity in expression of secondary metabolites of biological interest and provides new insight into designing and reconstituting their biosynthetic pathways.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by filamentous fungi possess diverse bioactivities that make them excellent drug candidates. Whole genome sequencing has revealed that fungi have the capacity to produce a far greater number of SMs than have been isolated, since many of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis are either silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions. There has been significant effort to activate SM biosynthetic genes and link them to their downstream products, as the SMs produced by these “cryptic” pathways offer a promising source for new drug discovery. Further, an understanding of the genes involved in SM biosynthesis facilitates product yield optimization of first-generation molecules and genetic engineering of second-generation analogs. This review covers advances made in genome mining SMs produced by Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus in the past six years (2012–2018). Genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters, along with proposed biosynthetic pathways, will be discussed in depth.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture (1–5). While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT (6–11). Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high dose radiation, and rapid loss of bone structure and density could facilitate fractures.

Knee and Hip Joint Cartilage Damage from Combined Spaceflight Hazards of Low-Dose Radiation Less than 1 Gy and Prolonged Hinlimb Unloading. Radiat. Res. 191, 497–506 (2019).
PARÁGRAFO: Reduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) and reduced weight bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints. C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading (HLU) or remained full-weight bearing (ground). On day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 Gy (sham), 0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy (n = 10/group), yielding eight groups: ground-sham; ground-0.1 Gy; ground-0.5 Gy; ground-1.0 Gy; HLU-sham; HLU-0.1 Gy; HLU-0.5 Gy; and HLU-1.0 Gy. On day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum were collected from the mice. Significant differences were identified statistically between treatment groups and the ground-sham control group, but no significant differences were observed between HLU and/or radiation groups. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CECT) demonstrated decrease in volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation. Further research is warranted with a focus on the prevention of cartilage degradation from long-term periods of reduced weight bearing and spaceflight-relevant low doses and qualities of radiation.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Both microgravity and radiation exposure in the spaceflight environment have been identified as hazards to astronaut health and performance. Substantial study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity, and the hazards presented by radiation from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and solar particle events (SPEs) outside of low earth orbit (LEO). To date, the majority of the ground-based analogues (e.g., rodent or cell culture studies) that investigate the biology of and risks associated with spaceflight hazards will focus on an individual hazard in isolation. However, astronauts will face these challenges simultaneously Combined hazard studies are necessary for understanding the risks astronauts face as they travel outside of LEO, and are also critical for countermeasure development. The focus of this review is to describe biologic and functional outcomes from ground-based analogue models for microgravity and radiation, specifically highlighting the combined effects of radiation and reduced weight-bearing from rodent ground-based tail suspension via hind limb unloading (HLU) and partial weight-bearing (PWB) models, although in vitro and spaceflight results are discussed as appropriate. The review focuses on the skeletal, ocular, central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and stem cells responses.

PARÁGRAFO: Reduced knee weight-bearing from prescription or sedentary lifestyles are associated with cartilage degradation; effects on the meniscus are unclear. Rodents exposed to spaceflight or hind limb unloading (HLU) represent unique opportunities to evaluate this question. This study evaluated arthritic changes in the medial knee compartment that bears the highest loads across the knee after actual and simulated spaceflight, and recovery with subsequent full weight-bearing. Cartilage and meniscal degradation in mice were measured via microCT, histology, and proteomics and/or biochemically after: (1) ~ 35 days on the International Space Station (ISS); (2) 13-days aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis; or (3) 30 days of HLU, followed by a 49-day weight-bearing readaptation with/without exercise. Cartilage degradation post-ISS and HLU occurred at similar spatial locations, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point, with meniscal volume decline. Cartilage and meniscal glycosaminoglycan content were decreased in unloaded mice, with elevated catabolic enzymes (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases), and elevated oxidative stress and catabolic molecular pathway responses in menisci. After the 13-day Shuttle flight, meniscal degradation was observed. During readaptation, recovery of cartilage volume and thickness occurred with exercise. Reduced weight-bearing from either spaceflight or HLU induced an arthritic phenotype in cartilage and menisci, and exercise promoted recovery.

PARÁGRAFO: Alpha(α)Klotho, a soluble transmembrane protein, facilitates calcium-phosphorus homeostasis through feedback between bone and kidney and is a potential systemic biomarker for bone-kidney health during spaceflight. We determined if: (1) plasma αKlotho was reduced after both spaceflight aboard the ISS and hindlimb unloading (HU); and (2) deficiency could be reversed with exercise. Both spaceflight and HU lowered circulating plasma αKlotho: plasma αKlotho recovered with exercise after HU.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a human lung carcinogen and a human health concern. The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered to be a driving mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, due to its highly accurate repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks. However, recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous recombination repair through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR repair that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is crucial to its function, this study investigated the effect of Cr(VI) on the RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, prolonged (120 h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, although RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results correlate temporally with the previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. In addition, we found Cr(VI) does not inhibit interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. Altogether, our results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In space, living organisms are exposed to multiple stress factors including microgravity and space radiation. For humans, these harmful environmental factors have been known to cause negative health impacts such as bone loss and immune dysfunction. Understanding the mechanisms by which spaceflight impacts human health at the molecular level is critical not only for accurately assessing the risks associated with spaceflight, but also for developing effective countermeasures. Over the years, a number of studies have been conducted under real or simulated space conditions. RNA and protein levels in cellular and animal models have been targeted in order to identify pathways affected by spaceflight. Of the many pathways responsive to the space environment, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) network appears to commonly be affected across many different cell types under the true or simulated spaceflight conditions. NF-κB is of particular interest, as it is associated with many of the spaceflight-related health consequences. This review intends to summarize the transcriptomics studies that identified NF-κB as a responsive pathway to ground-based simulated microgravity or the true spaceflight condition. These studies were carried out using either human cell or animal models. In addition, the review summarizes the studies that focused specifically on NF-κB pathway in specific cell types or organ tissues as related to the known spaceflight-related health risks including immune dysfunction, bone loss, muscle atrophy, central nerve system (CNS) dysfunction, and risks associated with space radiation. Whether the NF-κB pathway is activated or inhibited in space is dependent on the cell type, but the potential health impact appeared to be always negative. It is argued that more studies on NF-κB should be conducted to fully understand this particular pathway for the benefit of crew health in space.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: In space, multiple unique environmental factors, particularly microgravity and space radiation, pose constant threat to the DNA integrity of living organisms. Specifically, space radiation can cause damage to DNA directly, through the interaction of charged particles with the DNA molecules themselves, or indirectly through the production of free radicals. Although organisms have evolved strategies on Earth to confront such damage, space environmental conditions, especially microgravity, can impact DNA repair resulting in accumulation of severe DNA lesions. Ultimately these lesions, namely double strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, micronucleus formation, or mutations, can increase the risk for adverse health effects, such as cancer. How spaceflight factors affect DNA damage and the DNA damage response has been investigated since the early days of the human space program. Over the years, these experiments have been conducted either in space or using ground-based analogs. This review summarizes the evidence for DNA damage induction by space radiation and/or microgravity as well as spaceflight-related impacts on the DNA damage response. The review also discusses the conflicting results from studies aimed at addressing the question of potential synergies between microgravity and radiation with regard to DNA damage and cellular repair processes. We conclude that further experiments need to be performed in the true space environment in order to address this critical question.

PARÁGRAFO: The implementation of rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) for studying the effect of lack of gravity has attracted attention, especially in the fields of stem cells, tissue regeneration, and cancer research. Immune cells incubated in RWVs exhibit several features of immunosuppression including impaired leukocyte proliferation, cytokine responses, and antibody production. Interestingly, stress hormones influence cellular immune pathways affected by microgravity, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA repair, and T cell activation. These pathways are crucial defense mechanisms that protect the cell from toxins, pathogens, and radiation. Despite the importance of the adrenergic receptor in regulating the immune system, the effect of microgravity on the adrenergic system has been poorly studied. Thus, we elected to investigate the synergistic effects of isoproterenol (a sympathomimetic drug), radiation, and microgravity in nonstimulated immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated with the sympathomimetic drug isoproterenol, exposed to 0.8 or 2 Gy γ-radiation, and incubated in RWVs. Mixed model regression analyses showed significant synergistic effects on the expression of the β2-adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2). Radiation alone increased ADRB2 expression, and cells incubated in microgravity had more DNA strand breaks than cells incubated in normal gravity. We observed radiation-induced cytokine production only in microgravity. Prior treatment with isoproterenol clearly prevents most of the microgravity-mediated effects. RWVs may be a useful tool to provide insight into novel regulatory pathways, providing benefit not only to astronauts but also to patients suffering from immune disorders or undergoing radiotherapy.

PARÁGRAFO: Tissue preservation is a minimal requirement for the success of plant RNA and protein expression studies. The standard of snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen is not always practical or possible. RNAlater, a concentrated solution of ammonium and cesium sulfates, has become a standard preservative in the absence of liquid nitrogen. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RNAlater in preserving both RNA and proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for use in RNAseq and LC-MS/MS analysis of proteins. While successful in preserving plant material, a transcriptomic and proteomic response is evident. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins were found to be differentially expressed at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). This response is mirrored in the abundance of post-translational modifications, with 23 of the 108 (21.3%) phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance at a log-fold change of ±1 (P ≤ 0.05). While RNAlater is effective in preserving biological information, our findings warrant caution in its use for transcriptomic and proteomic experiments.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: With the construction of the International Space Station, humans have been continuously living and working in space for 22 years. Microbial studies in space and other extreme environments on Earth have shown the ability for bacteria and fungi to adapt and change compared to “normal” conditions. Some of these changes, like biofilm formation, can impact astronaut health and spacecraft integrity in a negative way, while others, such as a propensity for plastic degradation, can promote self-sufficiency and sustainability in space. With the next era of space exploration upon us, which will see crewed missions to the Moon and Mars in the next 10 years, incorporating microbiology research into planning, decision-making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long-duration missions. These can include astronaut microbiome studies to protect against infections, immune system dysfunction and bone deterioration, or biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU) studies that incorporate microbes to act as radiation shields, create electricity and establish robust plant habitats for fresh food and recycling of waste. In this review, information will be presented on the beneficial use of microbes in bioregenerative life support systems, their applicability to bISRU, and their capability to be genetically engineered for biotechnological space applications. In addition, we discuss the negative effect microbes and microbial communities may have on long-duration space travel and provide mitigation strategies to reduce their impact. Utilizing the benefits of microbes, while understanding their limitations, will help us explore deeper into space and develop sustainable human habitats on the Moon, Mars and beyond.

PARÁGRAFO: Finding sustainable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources is of pivotal importance for the future of space exploration. This is relevant not only to establish viable space exploration beyond low Earth–orbit, but also for ethical considerations associated with the generation of space waste and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. Here we propose and highlight a series of microbial biotechnologies uniquely suited to establish sustainable processes for in situ resource utilization and loop-closure. Microbial biotechnologies research and development for space sustainability will be translatable to Earth applications, tackling terrestrial environmental issues, thereby supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

PARÁGRAFO: While sequencing technologies have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial diversity, little is known about the dynamic emergent phenotypes that arise within the context of mixed-species populations, which are not fully predicted using sequencing technologies alone. The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.

PARÁGRAFO: Space exploration and extraterrestrial civilization have fascinated humankind since the earliest days of human history. It was only in the last century that humankind finally began taking significant steps towards these goals by sending astronauts into space, landing on the moon, and building the International Space Station. However, space voyage is very challenging and dangerous, and astronauts are under constant space radiation and microgravity. It has been shown that astronauts are at a high risk of developing a broad range of diseases/disorders. Thus, it is critical to develop a rapid and effective assay to monitor astronauts’ health in space. In this study, gene expression and correlation patterns were analyzed for 10 astronauts (8 male and 2 female) using the publicly available microarray dataset E-GEOD-74708. We identified 218 differentially expressed genes between In-flight and Pre-flight and noticed that space travel decreased genome regulation and gene correlations across the entire genome, as well as individual signaling pathways. Furthermore, we systematically developed a shortlist of 32 genes that could be used to monitor astronauts’ health during space travel. Further studies, including microgravity experiments, are warranted to optimize and validate the proposed assay.

PARÁGRAFO: In P. aeruginosa, alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.

PARÁGRAFO: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic human pathogen, capable of thriving in different environmental niches. Activation of the AlgU-regulated extracytoplasmic stress response results in the production of copious amounts of an exopolysaccharide called alginate, forming a capsule that protects the bacterium from the host-immune system. Alginate production by P. aeruginosa is a particular problem for patients with cystic fibrosis, whose dehydrated mucus-filled lungs provide an environment especially suited for bacterial infection (Folkesson et al., 2012). Nonmucoid strains initially colonize the lungs, and alginate overproduction caused by mutations in mucA results in a mucoid phenotype and a chronic lung infection (Ciofu et al., 2005; Hogardt et al., 2007; Mena et al., 2008). Among many roles in pathogenesis, alginate can promote adherence to lung epithelial cells, reduce the efficiency of phagocytosis, and protect bacteria from antibiotics (Govan and Deretic, 1996; Pier et al., 2001; Leid et al., 2005).
PARÁGRAFO: The extracytoplasmic stress-response pathways in P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and other Gram-negative bacteria involve regulated intramembrane proteolysis and share common features. For example, outer-membrane and periplasmic stress initiates a proteolytic cascade that ultimately degrades a transmembrane anti-sigma factor and releases the sigma factor to up-regulate stress-response genes (Alba et al., 2002; Kanehara et al., 2002; Walsh et al., 2003; Akiyama et al., 2004; Flynn et al., 2004; Chaba et al., 2007). In P. aeruginosa, proteolysis of wild type MucA, the anti-sigma factor, releases the AlgU sigma factor, which enhances transcription of the genes responsible for alginate biosynthesis from the algD promoter (Martin et al., 1993; Wood et al., 2006).
PARÁGRAFO: In P. aeruginosa, degradation of MucA is normally initiated by cleavage by the AlgW protease at site 1 near the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, continues with cleavage by the MucP protease at site 2 near the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and is completed in the cytoplasm by AAA+ proteases such as ClpXP (Akiyama et al., 2004; Alba et al., 2002; Chaba et al., 2007; Flynn et al., 2004; Kanehara et al., 2002; Qiu et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2008b; Walsh et al., 2003). Two signals are required to initiate this proteolytic cascade. The C-terminal peptides of proteins that accumulate in the periplasm during stress, including outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), bind to the PDZ domains of the trimeric AlgW protease and allosterically activate site-1 cleavage of MucA, but MucB competes for MucA binding and can inhibit this cleavage (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Recent studies show that lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a key component of the outer membrane, can bind MucB and cause release of MucA (Lima et al., 2013).
PARÁGRAFO: Here, we identify CupB5 as a novel activator of the alginate-production pathway. CupB5, an adhesive protein, is a member of one of the chaperone/usher pathways (CupA-E) that mediate assembly of pili and play roles in bacterial pathogenesis, adhesion, and biofilm formation (Hull et al., 1981; Marklund et al., 1992; Soto and Hultgren, 1999; Vallet et al., 2001; Giraud et al., 2011; Mikkelsen et al., 2009). These secretion systems, which are best characterized in Gram-negative bacteria (Sauer et al., 2000; Waksman and Hultgren, 2009), contain a periplasmic chaperone that maintains proteins to be secreted in an unassembled state and an usher that transports these proteins through the outer membrane. We find that overexpression of CupB5 in the absence of its chaperone induces a mucoid phenotype in P. aeruginosa and provide evidence that a peptide signal in CupB5 enhances OMP-activated cleavage of MucA by AlgW, even in the presence of MucB, allowing initiation of AlgU signaling.
PARÁGRAFO: To identify new alginate regulatory genes, we performed mariner-transposon mutagenesis (Wong and Mekalanos, 2000) in the nonmucoid P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1. We isolated a mucoid variant (PAO1-VE22) and identified the site of a single-copy insertion by inverse PCR and Southern-blot analysis (data not shown). The transposon insertion was six base pairs before the TAG stop codon at the 3′ end of cupB4 (Fig. 1A) and introduced a σ70-dependent PGm promoter that drove expression of the gentamicin resistance cassette and downstream genes (Rubin et al., 1999). Alginate production by PAO1-VE22 (31 ± 1.5 μg/ml/OD600) was substantially higher than that of PAO1 (8.5 ± 0.02 μg/ml/OD600) after 24 h growth at 37°C. To test if altered expression of cupB4, cupB5, or cupB6 was responsible for the mucoidy of PAO1-VE22, we cloned each individual coding sequence with an N-terminal HA epitope and C-terminal H6 tag in pHERD20T under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter (Qiu et al., 2008a). Plasmids expressing the tagged variant of CupB5, but not of CupB4 or CupB6, induced mucoid conversion and high-level alginate production in PAO1 (Fig. 1B). Western-blot analysis indicated that the plasmid-expressed CupB4, CupB5, and CupB6 variants were detectable when overexpressed in PAO1, albeit with fragmentation of CupB5 (Fig. 1C). We conclude that enhanced expression of CupB5 or a CupB5 fragment induces mucoidy and increased alginate in PAO1-VE22.
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Organization of the cupB1-cupB6 gene cluster (www.pseudomonas.com), and location of the transposon insertion site in PAO1-VE22. (B) Alginate production, measured using the carbazole assay, and colony phenotypes (M, mucoid; NM, nonmucoid) were assayed following transformation of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 with plasmid HERD20T or variants expressing HA-CupB4-H6, HA-CupB5-H6, or HA-CupB6-H6, and overnight growth of colonies on PIA plates (carbenecillin 300 μg ml−1, 0.1% L-arabinose) at 37°C. Values are averages ± SEM (n=3). (C) Cell lysates of PAO1 carrying appropriate plasmids were electrophoresed on SDS polyacrylamide gels, and Western-blots using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody were used to detect HA-CupB4-H6, HA-CupB5-H6, or HA-CupB6-H6. The rightmost lane shows that HA cross-reactive proteins were absent in PAO1 transformed with the pHERD20T empty-vector.
PARÁGRAFO: Deletion of five single genes required for the AlgU response (algW, mucP, clpX, clpP, or algU) in PAO1 prevented mucoidy and high-level alginate production when HA-CupB5-H6 was overproduced from a plasmid in these strains (Fig. 2A). In-frame deletion of algW in PAO1-VE22 also prevented alginate overproduction and mucoidy, a phenotype that was complemented by plasmid expression of AlgW but not AlgW lacking its PDZ domain (Fig. 2B). Consistently, when AlgU-dependent promoters were fused to lacZ and introduced into PAO1-VE22 or PAO1-VE2, a strain in which AlgW is activated by overproduction of MucE (Qiu et al., 2007), β-galactosidase levels were increased markedly compared to the same promoter fusions in PAO1 (Fig. S1). CupB5 is normally an extracellular protein (Ruer et al., 2008; Vallet et al., 2001). However, its overexpression in the absence of corresponding levels of the CupB4 chaperone and usher could result in periplasmic accumulation that acts directly or indirectly through AlgW to activate alginate production.
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Wild-type (WT) or mutant PAO1 strains were transformed with pHERD20 encoding HA-CupB5-H6, grown on PIA plates with 0.1% L-arabinose for 24 h at 37°C to induce HA-CupB5-H6 overexpression, and mucoid phenotypes and alginate production were determined. The algD gene encodes an enzyme required for alginate production. The algU, algW, mucP, clpX, and clpP genes are required for induction of algU-dependent alginate production. (B) Alginate production and mucoid phenotypes of different strains were measured after growth for 24 h at 37°C on PIA plates plus 300 μg m−1 carbenecillin and 0.1% L-Ara. In both panels, values are averages ± SEM (n=3).
PARÁGRAFO: Because C-terminal sequences terminating with an aromatic residue and α-carboxylate can activate AlgW, we initially tested if the C-terminal residues of CupB5 (Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018) were responsible for activating AlgW and inducing mucoidy. However, overexpression of CupB5 variants with a C-terminal H6 tag or containing a deletion of the Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018 sequence and a C-terminal H6 tag still induced mucoidy in PAO1 (Table S1). Thus, the extreme C-terminal residues of CupB5 play little or no role in mediating alginate overproduction. Moreover, overproduction of variants containing just the N-terminal 491 residues of CupB5 also induced mucoidy (Table S1), indicating that a major inducing signal is located in this portion of the protein.
PARÁGRAFO: Deletion analyses revealed that the Thr489-Val490-Val491 sequence of CupB5 appeared important for alginate overproduction. Specifically, overexpression of CupB51–491 produced substantially more alginate than overexpression of CupB51–489 or CupB51–488 (Fig. 3A), and Western blotting showed that these proteins were present at a similar intracellular levels (Fig. 3B). Cells expressing CupB51–490 also produced less alginate (Fig. 3A), but this protein appeared to be severely truncated by degradation (Fig. 3B). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the CupB5 activating signal included some or all of the Thr489-Val490-Val491 sequence.
PARÁGRAFO: (A) CupB5 variants with C-terminal truncations were cloned into pHERD20T, expressed in strain PAO1, and alginate production following growth in the presence of 1% L-arabinose was assayed. Proteins containing CupB5 residues 1–585 and 1–491 contain the complete GYYYTVV491 sequence motif. The remaining proteins contain only a portion of this motif. (B) Western-blot detection using anti-HA monoclonal antibody of truncated CupB5 variants.
PARÁGRAFO: We initially tested if synthetic peptides including the Thr489-Val490-Val491 CupB5 sequence might stimulate alginate production in a manner analogous to OMPs by activating AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA. One peptide (GYYYTVV) corresponded to the seven C-terminal residues of CupB51–491, another (YVGYVTY) was a sequence-scrambled variant, and a third (GYYYT) corresponded to the C-terminus of CupB51–489, which did not stimulate alginate production in vivo. We assayed the kinetics of AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA in vitro by the production of acid-soluble peptide fragments in the presence of different concentrations of the CupB5 peptides. Each CupB5 peptide stimulated AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA to a small degree, but at far lower rates than a peptide (WVF) corresponding to the C-terminal residues of MucE, a potent activator of AlgW (Fig. 4A & 4B). Thus, the CupB5 peptides do not substitute for OMP-like peptides in robust activation of AlgW cleavage of MucA.
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Cleavage of 35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) was assayed by the time-dependent release of acid-soluble peptides in the presence of either the OMP-like WVF peptide (400 μM), the wild-type GYYYT or GYYYTVV CupB5 peptides (400 μM), the sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (400 μM), or a buffer control. (B) Second-order rate constants for MucA cleavage were determined by incubating 35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) and AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) with different concentrations of WVF or CupB5 peptides and measuring the time-dependent increase in acid-soluble products. Rates were divided by the MucA and AlgW concentrations to determine activity. Lines are fits to the equation activity = basal + stimulated/(1+(Kact/[peptide])h). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2). (C) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of 35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were determined as described in panel B in the presence of different combinations of WVF peptide (110 μM), MucB (25 μM dimer), and wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides (405 μM). Values are averages of two or more independent trials ± SEM. (D) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of 35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of the GYYYT, GYYYTVV, or sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptides. Lines are fits to the Hill equation: rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Ks/[peptide])h). For GYYYT, Ks was 55 ± 13 μM and h was 2.1 ± 0.9. For GYYYTVV, Ks was 143 ± 31 μM and h was 3.5 ± 2.2.
PARÁGRAFO: As expected from previous studies (Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009), addition of MucB suppressed cleavage of 35S-MucA by WVF-activated AlgW (Fig. 4C). Moreover, addition of just the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT CupB5 peptides did not result in AlgW cleavage of MucA when MucB was present (Fig. 4C). Next, we tested if the wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides could relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA in the presence of the WVF activating peptide. Importantly, titration of GYYYTVV or GYYYT into reactions containing MucA, MucB, AlgW, and WVF peptide resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the rate of MucA cleavage (Fig. 4D). Almost no increase in MucA cleavage was observed with the scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (Fig. 4D), demonstrating sequence specificity. Interestingly, activation of MucA cleavage by GYYYT occurred at lower peptide concentrations and was less cooperative as judged by the Hill constant than activation by the GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 4D). Thus, the C-terminal valine residues of GYYYTVV are not necessary for activation of MucA cleavage in the presence of MucB in vitro. Although the GYYYTVV and GYYYT peptides activated AlgW cleavage of MucA to similar levels in the presence of WVF peptide and MucB, these levels were approximately one-third of the MucA cleavage rate observed with WVF and AlgW alone (compare Figs. 4B and 4D). We conclude that the CupB5 peptides can partially relieve MucB inhibition of WVF-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA.
PARÁGRAFO: Lipopolysaccharides bind MucB and competitively displace MucA (Lima et al., 2013). Because MucB normally binds peptide sequences in MucA, it seemed plausible that CupB5 peptides might also compete for MucA binding to MucB. We tested this possibility by assaying the ability of the CupB5 peptides to elute 35S-MucB from MucA that had been covalently bound to agarose resin (Fig. 5A). In this assay, the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment and free MucA efficiently competed with resin-bound MucA for MucB binding. However, incubation of 35S-MucB•MucA resin with the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT peptides resulted in no more 35S-MucB release than observed in the buffer control (Fig. 5A). This result strongly suggests that the CupB5 peptides do not relieve MucB inhibition by directly competing for its binding to MucA. Binding of the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment converts MucB dimers to tetramers (Lima et al., 2013). By contrast, incubation of MucB with GYYYTVV peptide resulted in no substantial change in elution during gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. S2).
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Release of 35S-MucB from MucA-agarose following incubation with buffer, MucA (155 μM), L-IIA (20 mg/mL), or CupB5 peptides (~300 μM). For the CupB5 peptides, values are averages ± SEM (n=3). For L-IIA, the value is the average ± SEM (n=2). (B) Rates of cleavage by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were measured at different concentrations of 35S-MucA in the presence or absence of CupB5 peptides (300 μM). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2) and were fit to the Hill form of the Michaelis-Menten equation, rate = Vmax/(1 + (KM/[substrate])h). (C) Rates of cleavage of 35S-MucA (50 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were assayed at difference concentrations of WVF peptide in the presence or absence of CupB5 peptides (300 μM). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2) and were fit to the equation rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Kact/[peptide])h). Without CupB5 peptide, h was 2.2 ± 1, Kact was 11 ± 2 μM, and Vmax was 1250 ± 150 M−1 s−1. With GYYYTVV peptide, h was 1.5 ± 0.8, Kact was 18 ± 7 μM, and Vmax was 2490 ± 490 M−1 s−1.
PARÁGRAFO: Because CupB5 peptides did not strongly activate AlgW cleavage of MucA in the absence of the WVF peptide or release MucA from MucB, we speculated that they might act in concert with the WVF peptide to allow AlgW to bind and degrade MucA more efficiently and thus to compete better with MucB for the MucA substrate. This model predicts that MucA should be degraded at a faster rate in the presence of both the WVF and CupB5 peptides. Indeed, when we assayed the rate of cleavage of different concentrations of 35S-MucA by AlgW, faster cleavage was observed when both the WVF and wild-type CupB5 peptides were present compared to only the WVF peptide or the WVF peptide and scrambled CupB5 control peptide (Fig. 5B). We also measured the rate of AlgW cleavage of a fixed concentration of MucA in the presence of increasing concentrations of WVF peptide with or without additional GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 5C). When GYYYTVV peptide was present, the maximum rate of MucA cleavage increased almost two-fold. We conclude that the CupB5 peptides and WVF peptide act synergistically to enhance AlgW cleavage of MucA, allowing better competition with MucB.
PARÁGRAFO: In E. coli, RseA, RseB, and DegS are homologs of MucA, MucB, and AlgW. A YYF peptide efficiently activates DegS cleavage of RseA in the absence of RseB or in the presence of both RseB and lipopolysaccharides (Walsh et al., 2003; Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2007; Lima et al., 2013). The CupB5 peptides did not substantially stimulate cleavage of 35S-RseA by YYF-activated DegS in the presence of RseB (Fig. S3), suggesting that they do not interact with DegS. This result is not surprising, as DegS and AlgW share only 44% sequence homology.
PARÁGRAFO: If CupB5 allows AlgW to compete more efficiently with MucB for MucA binding and cleavage, then overproduction of MucB in strain PAO1-VE22 would be expected to decrease alginate production. Indeed, plasmid-mediated MucB overproduction had this effect, as did plasmid-mediated overproduction of MucA (Fig. 6A). The latter result suggests that with enough additional uncleaved MucA, AlgU is efficiently inhibited even when more MucA is degraded than usual. Even the CupB5-induced elevated rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in this strain must be too slow to free enough AlgU to fully enhance transcription of alginate biosynthesis genes.
PARÁGRAFO: (A) Strains overproducing CupB5 (PAO1-VE22) or MucE (PAO1-VE2) were transformed with plasmid HERD20T or variants overexpressing MucA or MucB, grown at 37°C for 24 h on PIA plates supplemented with 0.1% L-arabinose, and alginate production and colony phenotypes (M, mucoid; NM, nonmucoid) were assayed. (B) Alginate production and mucoid phenotypes were assayed in strains PAO1, PAO1-VE2 (mucE overexpressed), PAO1 mucB::tetR (mucB inactivated), and PAO1-VE22 (cupB5 overexpressed) transformed with the HERD20T plasmid vector or variants expressing HA-CupB4-H6 or HA-CupB5-H6. Values are averages ± SEM (n=3). Statistical significance was determine using the Student’s t-test (*P<0.05; **<0.005).
PARÁGRAFO: Plasmid-expressed MucB or MucA also decreased alginate production in PAO1-VE2, a strain expressing higher MucE levels (Fig. 6A). The rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in PAO1-VE2 is apparently too low to fully degrade the excess MucA, resulting in greater inhibition of AlgU and reduced alginate production. Excess MucB presumably outstrips the endogenous anti-MucB signals in PAO1-VE2 and mass action results in enhanced binding to MucA, reducing the rate of MucA cleavage by activated AlgW.
PARÁGRAFO: To determine how simultaneous overexpression of MucE and CupB5 affected alginate levels,, we transformed PAO1-VE2 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H6. Notably, alginate levels in this strain were higher than in the empty-vector control (Fig. 6B), suggesting that activation of AlgW through MucE and through CupB5 occur synergistically. Our biochemical results predict that MucB should not be genetically required for CupB5-mediated pathway activation. To test this prediction, we used a transposon-insertion strain, PAO1-mucB::tetR, which displayed an elevated level of basal alginate production and mucoid phenotype (Fig. 6B). When we transformed PAO1-mucB::tetR with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H6, alginate production increased compared to the empty-vector control (Fig. 6B), indicating that CupB5 overexpression induces pathway activation by a MucB-independent mechanism. Finally, we tested if expression of the CupB4 chaperone, which should facilitate export of CupB5 rather than its periplasmic accumulation, would decrease alginate production. Indeed, when we transformed PAO1-VE22 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB4-H6, alginate production was suppressed and the mucoid phenotype of the parent strain was reversed (Fig. 6B). This result supports a model in which interactions between accumulated periplasmic CupB5 and periplasmic AlgW leads to induction of alginate production and mucoidy.
PARÁGRAFO: Based on results from a transposon screen in P. aeruginosa, we discovered that overexpression of CupB5, a protein normally secreted through the outer membrane by a chaperone-usher system, activates alginate production and results in mucoid colonies. CupB5-mediated mucoidy depends on known components of the AlgU stress-response pathway, including the AlgU transcription factor and the AlgW, MucP, and ClpXP proteases. Peptides from a region of CupB5 important for elevated alginate production in vivo stimulate cleavage of MucA by OMP-activated AlgW in vitro and partially relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of MucA. Overexpression of either MucB or MucA in strains that overexpress CupB5 also reduces alginate production, supporting a model in which excess periplasmic CupB5 stimulates proteolytic cleavage of MucA by AlgW.
PARÁGRAFO: We found that expression of HA-CupB51–491-H6 in PAO1 increased alginate production in vivo and demonstrated that a GYYYTVV peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485–491) antagonized MucB inhibition in vitro. A peptide with the same composition as GYYYTVV but a scrambled sequence did not inhibit MucB. However, we also found that expression of HA-CupB51–489-H6 failed to increase alginate production in vivo, whereas a GYYYT peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485–489) did antagonize MucB inhibition in vitro. This discrepancy between results in vivo and in vitro could arise because the GYYYT peptide in HA-CupB51–489-H6 is altered by proteolysis or is masked by tertiary structure, aggregation, or binding to another cellular component. We also note that expression of full-length HA-CupB5-H6 and truncated HA-CupB51–585-H6 resulted in somewhat higher alginate levels than expression of HA-CupB51–491-H6. This variation could arise from differences in expression levels, cellular interactions, or possibly as a consequence of additional peptide sequences in the longer proteins that facilitate pathway activation.
PARÁGRAFO: We initially thought that CupB5 peptides might bind MucB and compete for binding to MucA in a manner analogous to LPS. However, neither GYYYTVV nor GYYYT peptides compete with MucA-agarose for MucB binding and saturating concentrations of these peptides only partially relieve MucB inhibition in vitro. Moreover, unlike LPS, GYYYTVV did not convert MucB dimers into tetramers. By themselves, CupB5 peptides activate AlgW cleavage in vitro far less well than the OMP-like WVF peptide. However, CupB5 peptides stimulate MucA cleavage by WVF-activated AlgW, suggesting that OMP-like and CupB5 peptides bind to distinct sites in AlgW but have a common effect of stabilizing the proteolytically active enzyme.
PARÁGRAFO: The GYYYTVV sequence is conserved in CupB5 proteins from different strains of P. aeruginosa but not in CupB5 proteins from other Pseudomonas species (Fig. S3), and some Pseudomonas species have no CupB5 ortholog. Thus, CupB5 activation of AlgW is specific to P. aeruginosa. It remains to be determined if P. aeruginosa utilizes other proteins in this manner or if AlgW homologs in other bacteria are activated by more than one kind of peptide signal.
PARÁGRAFO: Activation of the AlgU pathway requires one molecular signal (C-terminal OMP peptides) to activate site-1 cleavage of MucA by the AlgW protease and a second molecular signal (LPS) to relieve MucB inhibition of this cleavage. Overproduction of CupB5 can partially bypass this second requirement by helping OMP-bound AlgW compete with MucB for MucA binding and proteolysis. Expression of CupB5 under non-stress conditions increases alginate production similarly to non-stress expression of MucE (Qiu et al., 2007). In these experiments, a signal that directly antagonizes MucB inhibition could arise indirectly as a consequence of other molecules whose concentrations increase as a consequence of CupB5 or MucE expression or might always be present at some level in the periplasm. For example, some level of unassembled OMPs and LPS is probably always present in the periplasm. Notably, however, simultaneous expression of CupB5 and MucE results in higher levels of alginate, indicating that these signals activate the alginate pathway through synergistic mechanisms
PARÁGRAFO: Although CupB5 peptides, OMP peptides, and LPS molecules function by different mechanisms to activate AlgW or relieve MucB inhibition, the molecular logic that gives rise to all three signals is similar. For example, stresses that compromise the transport to and outer-membrane assembly of OMPs and LPS, or that slow usher-mediated CupB5 secretion, would all lead to the periplasmic accumulation of these molecules and activation of the AlgU pathway. Indeed, we found that alginate production was suppressed in strains that overproduced the CupB4 chaperone, allowing export of CupB5. Certain stresses might only activate AlgW through OMP signals, whereas others require an enhanced response via CupB5 or possibly other proteins secreted through the outer membrane. Clearly, however, the AlgU system integrates multiple signals, each reporting on potential dysfunction in outer-membrane assembly, structure, and/or secretion. Dysfunction in just one pathway should give rise to a buffered AlgU response, whereas dysfunction affecting multiple pathways would elicit a robust AlgU response.
PARÁGRAFO: Bacteria strains and plasmids used in this study are shown in Table S2. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37°C in Lennox broth (LB) or LB agar. P. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37°C in LB, Pseudomonas isolation broth (PIB, Alpha Bioscience) or on Pseudomonas isolation agar (PIA) plates (Difco). When required, the concentration of carbenicillin, tetracycline or gentamicin added to LB broth or plates was 100 μg ml−1, 20 μg ml−1, or 15 μg ml−1, respectively, and 300 μg ml−1, 150 μg ml&−1, or 200 μg ml−1 when added to PIB or PIA plates, respectively.
PARÁGRAFO: Transposon mutagenesis was carried out via biparental conjugations using E. coli SM10 λpir carrying plasmid pFAC as the donor strain (Wong and Mekalanos, 2000) and PAO1 as the recipient strain. After incubating PAO1 and E. coli cells on LB agar plates at 37°C for 6 h, bacteria were collected, re-suspended in PBS and then plated onto PIA supplemented with gentamicin (200 μg ml−1). Mucoid colonies were identified. The chromosomal DNA of mucoid mutants was isolated using the QIAamp genomic DNA Extraction kit (Qiagen, USA). Approximately, 2 μg of DNA was digested with SalI overnight at 37°C, followed by purification and self-ligation using Fast-Link DNA ligase (Epicentre, USA). The circular closed DNA was used as a template for inverse PCR using GM3OUT and GM5OUT primers (Qiu et al., 2008b). The PCR products were purified and sequenced. Finally, Southern-blot hybridization was also conducted to monitor the copy number of transposon insertions using the Gmr gene as the probe (Head and Yu, 2004).
PARÁGRAFO: All DNA cloning was performed using PCR products digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligated into the E. coli to Pseudomonas shuttle vector pHERD20T (Qiu et al., 2008a). All constructs of pHERD20T were sequenced to verify the correct DNA sequences. DNA sequencing was carried out by the Marshall University Genomics Core Facility. The primer sequences used for PCR cloning will be provided upon request. The transformation of One Shot TOP10 (Invitrogen, USA) was performed according to the supplier’s instruction. The transfer of pHERD20T and its derivatives was performed via triparental conjugation using the helper plasmid pRK2013 (Figurski and Helinski, 1979).
PARÁGRAFO: For extraction of total cellular protein, PeriPreps™ Periplasting Kit (Epicentre, USA) was used. Bacteria were inoculated in PIB medium and incubated in shake culture for several hours, until the OD600 was ~0.6. At this point 0.1% L-arabinose was added to induce protein expression. Two hours after induction, bacteria were collected for cell lysis. The protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad Dc protein assay reagents (Bio-Rad). Equivalent proteins were mixed with 2×sample loading buffer and analyzed on 10–20% pre-cast SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE) by electro-blotting for immunodetection. A primary antibody, rat Anti-HA (Roche, USA), was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Goat anti-rat immunoglobulin G (heavy and light chains) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce, USA) diluted 1: 5000 was used as the secondary antibody. Finally, the proteins on the membrane were visualized using the Amersham ECL kit (GE, USA).
PARÁGRAFO: P. aeruginosa strains were grown at 37°C on triplicate PIA plates for 24 h. Bacteria were collected, suspended in PBS, and the OD600 was measured and adjusted to ~0.5 by addition of PBS. The suspensions were analyzed for the amount of uronic acid in comparison with a standard curve made with D-mannuronic acid lactone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as described (Damron et al., 2009).
PARÁGRAFO: Pseudomonas strains carrying the lacZ vector pLP170 containing PalgU, and PalgD were cultured on PIA plates. After 24 h, bacteria were harvested, resuspended in PBS, and OD600 was measured and adjusted to ~0.3. Cells were then permeabilized using toluene, and β-galactosidase activity was measured at OD420 and OD550. The results in Miller Units were calculated according to the follow formula: Miller Units=1000×[OD 420−(1.75 × OD 550)]/[Reaction time (m) × Volume (ml) × OD 600] (Miller, 1972). The reported values represent an average of three independent experiments ± SEM.
PARÁGRAFO: Purifications of P. aeruginosa MucA, MucB and AlgW and E. coli RseA, RseB and DegS were performed as described after plasmid-mediated overexpression in E. coli strain X90(DE3) (Sohn et al., 2007; Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Cultures containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin were grown to an OD600 of ~0.6, and protein expression was induced with 100 mM IPTG for two h before harvesting. Cells overexpressing MucB, AlgW, RseB or DegS were resuspended in native lysis buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 500 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole] and lysed by sonication. Cells overexpressing MucA or RseA were resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 8 M guanidine hydrochloride (pH 8)] and allowed to lyse at room temperature for 30 min. For all preparations, lysates were cleared by centrifugation and applied to Ni-NTA columns pre-equilibrated in native lysis buffer or denaturing lysis buffer. Columns were washed with lysis buffer and proteins eluted with elution buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 500 mM KCl, 500 mM imidazole; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole]. Proteins were then dialyzed overnight against storage buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA] and then again against fresh buffer before being stored frozen at −80°C. Prior to dialysis and storage, MucB and RseB were chromatographed on a size-exclusion column and only fractions corresponding to the dimer were collected. To obtain radiolabeled 35S-MucA,35S-RseA, or 35S-MucB, cells were grown in a defined rich medium (TekNova) lacking methionine and 35S-methionine was added upon induction. Purification of 35S-MucA and 35S-RseA then proceeded as described above for unlabeled MucA and RseA. Cells expressing 35S-MucB were lysed by the addition of lysozyme and three freeze-thaw cycles, and purification then proceeded as described above. All peptides were synthesized by GenScript and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column. Purified products were lyophilized, stored at −20°C, then resuspended in storage buffer and used immediately. The L-IIA LPS fragment was a gift from Santiago Lima (MIT) (Lima et al., 2013).
PARÁGRAFO: Assays were performed as described (Sohn et al., 2007; Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009). Briefly, cleavage reactions were performed at 25°C in reaction buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol; E. coli proteins: 150 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.3), 380 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 4 mM EDTA]. Reactions were initiated by the addition of protease and quenched after different times by addition of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation, acid-soluble reaction products were quantified by scintillation counting and compared to total radioactivity from control samples. Cleavage activity for peptide-activation assays and experiments involving MucB are reported as a second-order rate constant calculated by dividing the rate of substrate cleavage by the substrate and enzyme concentrations. Activity at different substrate concentrations for the Michaelis-Menten curve was calculated by dividing the rate of substrate cleavage by the enzyme concentration.
PARÁGRAFO: Dry cyanogen-bromide activated Sepharose B4 resin (66 mg) was washed with 1 M HCl, equilibrated with coupling buffer [25 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.3), 50 mM NaCl], and incubated with purified MucA (900 μg) for 1.5 hours. After removal of free protein, reactive groups on the resin were blocked by incubation in 0.5 M ethanolamine (pH 8.3) for 1 h. The MucA resin was washed, resuspended in coupling buffer, and stored at 4 °C. For assays, MucA resin was drained, incubated with a four-fold molar excess of 35S-MucB, washed again, incubated with ligand for 30 min, added to a pre-wetted 96-well Multiscreen HTS-HV Filter Plate (Millipore) over a 96-well polypropylene receiving plate (Greiner), and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 1 min. Elution of 35S-MucB was measured by scintillation counting and normalized by dividing by the total initial 35S-MucB radioactivity.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: It is theorized that toxic agents are transported from the hyperpermeable gut of burn victims through the lymph, to the systemic circulation, causing global injury. We believe that immune cells respond to leakage of “toxic lymph” following trauma causing the attraction of these cells to the perilymphatic space. To test this, we utilized a model of burn on rats to examine changes in a single immune cell population associated with mesenteric lymphatic dysfunction. We examined the ability of serum from these animals to increase permeability in lymphatic endothelial monolayers and disrupt cellular junctions. We also treated burn animals with doxycycline, an inhibitor of microvascular permeability, and observed the effects on immune cell populations, morphometry, and lymphatic endothelial permeability. Burn injury increased the number of MHCII+ immune cells along the vessel (>50%). The size and shape of these cells also changed significantly following burn injury. Serum from burn animals increased lymphatic endothelial permeability (∼1.5-fold) and induced breaks in VE-cadherin staining. Doxycycline treatment blocked the accumulation of immune cells along the vessel, whereas serum from doxycycline-treated animals failed to increase lymphatic endothelial permeability. The size of cells along the vessel in doxycycline-treated burn animals was not affected, suggesting that the cells already present on the lymphatic vessels still respond to substances in the lymph. These findings suggest that factors produced during burn can induce lymphatic endothelial barrier disruption and lymph produced during traumatic injury can influence the attraction and morphology of immune cell populations along the vessel.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Space experiments are a technically challenging but a scientifically important part of astrobiology and astrochemistry research. The International Space Station (ISS) is an excellent example of a highly successful and long-lasting research platform for experiments in space, that has provided a wealth of scientific data over the last two decades. However, future space platforms present new opportunities to conduct experiments with the potential to address key topics in astrobiology and astrochemistry. In this perspective, the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry (with feedback from the wider scientific community) identifies a number of key topics and summarizes the 2021 “ESA SciSpacE Science Community White Paper” for astrobiology and astrochemistry. We highlight recommendations for the development and implementation of future experiments, discuss types of in situ measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios and orbits, and identify knowledge gaps and how to advance scientific utilization of future space-exposure platforms that are either currently under development or in an advanced planning stage. In addition to the ISS, these platforms include CubeSats and SmallSats, as well as larger platforms such as the Lunar Orbital Gateway. We also provide an outlook for in situ experiments on the Moon and Mars, and welcome new possibilities to support the search for exoplanets and potential biosignatures within and beyond our solar system.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: As we aim to expand human presence in space, we need to find viable approaches to achieve independence from terrestrial resources. Space biomining of the Moon, Mars and asteroids has been indicated as one of the promising approaches to achieve in-situ resource utilization by the main space agencies. Structural and expensive metals, essential mineral nutrients, water, oxygen and volatiles could be potentially extracted from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks using microbial-based biotechnologies. The use of bioleaching microorganisms could also be applied to space bioremediation, recycling of waste and to reinforce regenerative life support systems. However, the science around space biomining is still young. Relevant differences between terrestrial and extraterrestrial conditions exist, including the rock types and ores available for mining, and a direct application of established terrestrial biomining techniques may not be a possibility. It is, therefore, necessary to invest in terrestrial and space-based research of specific methods for space applications to learn the effects of space conditions on biomining and bioremediation, expand our knowledge on organotrophic and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as on anaerobic biomining, and investigate the use of synthetic biology to overcome limitations posed by the space environments.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Bacterial behavior has been studied under microgravity conditions, but very little is known about it under lunar and Martian gravitational regimes. An Earth-based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in-house-developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 RPM. With this setup, growth dynamics, phenotypic changes, and sensitivity to antibiotics (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of two different classes of antibiotics) for three Escherichia coli strains (including uropathogenic) were examined under simulated micro-, lunar, and Martian gravities. The results included increased growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities for some strains, and higher concentrations of antibiotics needed under simulated lunar gravity with respect to simulated micro- and Martian gravities. Clinostat-produced results can be considered suggestive but not determinative of what might be expected in altered gravity, as there is still a need to systematically verify these simulation devices’ ability to accurately replicate phenomena observed in space. Nevertheless, this approach serves as a baseline to start interrogating key cellular and molecular aspects relevant to microbial processes on the lunar and Martian surfaces.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The undesirable, yet inevitable, presence of bacterial biofilms in spacecraft poses a risk to the proper functioning of systems and to astronauts’ health. To mitigate the risks that arise from them, it is important to understand biofilms’ behavior in microgravity. As part of the Space Biofilms project, biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were grown in spaceflight over material surfaces. Stainless Steel 316 (SS316) and passivated SS316 were tested for their relevance as spaceflight hardware components, while a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS) was tested as potential biofilm control strategy. The morphology and gene expression of biofilms were characterized. Biofilms in microgravity are less robust than on Earth. LIS strongly inhibits biofilm formation compared to SS. Furthermore, this effect is even greater in spaceflight than on Earth, making LIS a promising option for spacecraft use. Transcriptomic profiles for the different conditions are presented, and potential mechanisms of biofilm reduction on LIS are discussed.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: A biological life support system for spaceflight would capture carbon dioxide waste produced by living and working in space to generate useful organic compounds. Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism to fix carbon into organic molecules. Microalgae are highly efficient at converting light, water, and carbon dioxide into biomass, particularly under limiting, artificial light conditions that are a necessity in space photosynthetic production. Although there is great promise in developing algae for chemical or food production in space, most spaceflight algae growth studies have been conducted on solid agar-media to avoid handling liquids in microgravity. Here we report that breathable plastic tissue culture bags can support robust growth of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the Veggie plant growth chamber, which is used on the International Space Station (ISS) to grow terrestrial plants. Live cultures can be stored for at least 1 month in the bags at room temperature. The gene set required for growth in these photobioreactors was tested using a competitive growth assay with mutations induced by short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC) mutagenesis in either wild-type (CC-5082) or cw15 mutant (CC-1883) strains at the start of the assay. Genome sequencing identified UVC-induced mutations, which were enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations relative to natural variants among laboratory strains. Genes with mutations indicating positive selection were enriched for information processing genes related to DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These data suggest that modification of DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport may be needed to improve growth rates in this spaceflight production system.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The establishment of steady-state continuous crop production during long-term deep space missions is critical for providing consistent nutritional and psychological benefits for the crew, potentially improving their health and performance. Three technology demonstrations were completed achieving simultaneous multi-species plant growth and the concurrent use of two Veggie units on the International Space Station (ISS). Microbiological characterization using molecular and culture-based methods was performed on leaves and roots from two harvests of three leafy greens, red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. ‘Outredgeous’); mizuna mustard, (Brassica rapa var japonica); and green leaf lettuce, (Lactuca sativa cv. Waldmann’s) and associated rooting pillow components and Veggie chamber surfaces. Culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. Surface samples of the Veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi and are commonly isolated on ISS. Community analysis was completed with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from VEG-03D, E, and F revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick. This work provides valuable information for food production-related research on the ISS and the impact of the plant microbiome on this unique closed environment.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth’s magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [Brassica rapa var. japonica]. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In general, the extent of damage depends on the seed type.

PARÁGRAFO: Plants were essential to the early evolution of terrestrial life and colonization of the young Earth (Kapoor et al., 2023). Plant communities continue to colonize and transform our planet including the newest ecosystems formed post-glaciation, restoring those degraded by human activities and adapting to changing ecological conditions (Huston and Smith, 1987; Chapin et al., 1994; Yuan et al., 2020; Heim et al., 2021). Plants cannot move away from a harmful stimulus, and thus, have evolved remarkable strategies to survive and eventually thrive in harsh environments. Today, humanity is on the verge of exploring our solar system and beyond, eager to discover, answer fundamental questions, and search for extraterrestrial forms of life. Undoubtedly, plants are key organisms to successful deep space missions and independence from the provision of terrestrial resources, whether for long duration interplanetary travel or establishing permanent settlements. We can employ terrestrial bio-design principles to mimic plant colonization on Earth and explore adaptations to novel ecosystems. This can be combined with precise molecular tools to enable long-term human space exploration. With this thought in mind, we have collated articles focusing on terrestrial plants from extreme environments and their adaptations to harsh conditions. This collective knowledge will advance the selection of desired plant characteristics relevant to human space missions and assist in the identification of valuable adaptive mechanisms that can be genetically engineered in targeted space food plants. Furthermore, terrestrial plants from the edge of habitability define limits for terrestrial forms of life and thus can direct efforts for the search for life beyond Earth (McKay, 2014; Huwe et al., 2019).
PARÁGRAFO: In this Research Topic, De Micco et al. present an exhaustive review on the hazards of cosmic ionizing radiation to human exploration and discuss potential roles for plants in mitigating this Research Topic. The authors highlight difficulties in studying ionizing radiation in deep space that stem from deploying inadequate radiation sources, limited access to ion beam accelerators, and lack of uniformity in radiation doses and dose rates (acute, chronic) across studies. The authors expand on the remarkable resistance of plants growing in regions of high radioactivity and the possibility of using such plants in shielding or for pharmaceutical countermeasures. Next, Molina-Montenegro et al. demonstrate the benefits of co-culturing relevant crops with endophytic fungi in simulated deep space environments to augment plant performance in high UV radiation, low temperature, and low water availability. In this instance, plants from mesic habitats were combined with fungi from the extreme environment of the Atacama Desert, which as the driest place in the world and also experiences excessive solar irradiance. Increased survival in crops inoculated with desert fungi was related to higher biomass, antioxidant content and nutritional quality in deep space-like environmental conditions compared to non-inoculated plants. Thus, Molina- Montenegro et al. contribute to developing the use of symbionts from extreme terrestrial environments to improve the efficiency of crop cultivation in space.
PARÁGRAFO: In another study, Gong et al. challenged emerging seedlings with growth mediums of varying particle size, porosity, and compactness, which is pivotal to understanding the intricacies of germinating seeds in extraterrestrial regolith in future space farms. Extraterrestrial regolith on anhydrous and airless celestial bodies is formed by vastly different processes than terrestrial soils. These processes include large and small meteoroid impacts, star plasma winds, and cosmic ionizing radiation, and cause distinct mechanical, physical, and hydraulic properties. Gravitational effects further impact regolith formation by affecting collision and aggregation velocities, which influences the values of bulk densities and the porosity of the outermost regolith layers. Using CT scans corroborated by mathematical models, Gong et al. demonstrate that underground seedlings search for a path of least resistance irrespective of the distance to the surface, and that high porosity and low compactness of the growth medium are conducive to seedling emergence. This finding informs plant cultivation on the Moon using in situ regolith. Due to micrometeoroid impacts, lunar regolith has very fine, low- density particles with complex shapes, sharp jagged edges, and a high angular surface. According to Gong et al., these tight and abrasive pore spaces could impede seedling path to the surface. However, the lower gravitational field on the Moon results in much lower regolith bulk densities, hence low compactness, which, according to the findings of Gong et al., is likely to promote seedling emergence.
PARÁGRAFO: Another study in this Research Topic addressed the quest for extraterrestrial life. Battistuzzi et al. explore if the light spectrum emissions from faint and cool stars is sufficient for oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. This is relevant to the search for oxygen biosignatures on exoplanets orbiting M-dwarf or Red Dwarf stars in habitable zones. These stars emit light at the far-red (700–750nm) and infrared (750–1000nm) wavelengths, unlike the Sun, which emits light predominantly in the visible and UV spectrum. On Earth, photosynthesizing plants harvest solar blue and red light for the light reactions of photosynthesis, so the capacity for low energy photons at longer wavelengths to photolyze H2O was unknown. Battistuzzi et al. show that cyanobacteria can acclimate to the simulated M-dwarf light spectrum by elevating the concentration of pigments capable of quenching low-energy photons and by increasing the efficiency of utilizing the sparse high-energy photons. There was no difference in biomass production nor O2 release between cyanobacteria grown under either light spectrum. This demonstrates that the photosynthetic apparatus, which evolved in the earliest terrestrial life forms, could perform in the presence of cool and dim starlight. As such, Battistuzzi et al. contribute a rare physiological analysis to theoretical models evaluating the feasibility of M-dwarf stars to support photosynthesis. This informs and legitimizes the search for oxygen biosignatures.
PARÁGRAFO: This Research Topic was conceived with the intent to present research, methods, and reviews to further our understanding of plant survival in harsh or novel environments, and that can be extrapolated to the conditions found in deep space. As humanity leaves Earth’s protective influence to explore the solar system and beyond, we require the knowledge and ideas developed by plant scientists, such as those assembled in this Research Topic, to take plants with us and deploy them to perform mission-critical functions. Once at the destination, guided by the knowledge of plant evolutionary solutions, we will know where to look for extraterrestrial life.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Over the past 30 years, organs-on-a-chip (OOCs) have emerged as a robust alternative to address the technological challenges associated with current in vitro and in vivo options. Although OOCs offer improved bio-relevance and controlled complexity, broad adoption has remained limited. Most approaches to characterize on-chip structure and function require human intervention, limiting device translation and feasibility. Here, we introduce a new fiber optic-based sensing platform that enables automated, temporal luminescence sensing on-chip, validated for real-time readout of epithelial and endothelial barrier function under cytokine-induced inflammation. Our platform, capable of at least 1 μM resolution, tracked paracellular transport in situ for 9 days of culture under perfusion on-chip. These results offer an alternative sensing approach for continuous, non-invasive luminescence monitoring in OOCs.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit is primarily associated with site-specific microgravity unloading of weight-bearing sites in the skeleton. Microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on ISS for 37 days in the NASA Rodent Research-1 experiment show significant site-specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in L2 vertebrae. The lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same-animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in Low Earth Orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. Remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. Furthermore, mice housed in the NASA ISS Rodent Habitat during 1g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. These findings suggest that housing in the Rodent Habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3D wire-mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight-bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. In summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight-bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. Additionally, we identified early-onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.

PARÁGRAFO: Space flight exposes astronauts to stressors that alter the immune response, rendering them vulnerable to infections and diseases. In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Space travel is a growing area of interest and includes initiatives such as NASA’s Moon-to-Mars Mission. Reports on the cardiovascular effects of space travel reveal changes in morphology, metabolism, and function of the cardiovascular system. In this study, the cardiovascular response to immunization in space was studied in mice which were housed and immunized while on the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid combined with the adjuvant CpG (TT + CpG) and the effects of vaccination in space were studied using transcriptomics. Analysis of the mouse heart transcriptome was performed on flight control and flight-immunized mice. The results show that immunization aboard the ISS stimulates heightened inflammation in the heart via induction of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway to promote the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL-17 and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes included alterations in the cytoskeleton and in the expression of transcripts associated with protection from oxidative stress. In summary, inflammation in the heart can occur following immunization in space. This investigation explores the impact of immune challenges on the heart and lays the groundwork for future research into additional cardiac alterations which can occur during spaceflight.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel.

PARÁGRAFO: Men and women have different cardiovascular responses to spaceflight; however, few studies have focused on direct comparisons between sexes. We investigated the mechanisms of aortic stiffening in socially and sexually mature 20-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats exposed to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 14 days. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was greater in the aortic arch of females after HLU versus control females (n = 6–8). HLU had no effect on aortic PWV in males (n = 5–6). Aortic α smooth muscle actin, myosin, collagen, elastin, and collagen-to-elastin ratio were not different in rats of either sex following HLU. The levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) were lower in the aorta of SD females exposed to HLU compared with female controls but were not altered in males. HLU females also had lower aortic PPARγ, increased oxidative stress markers, and diastolic dysfunction compared with control females. GPER agonist G1 prevented the increase in PWV and 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine without altering PPARγ or p47phox in HLU females (n = 4 in each group) suggesting that lower GPER may contribute to arterial stiffening in the setting of simulated microgravity. This study highlights sex-specific vascular adaptations to the state of simulated microgravity.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The development of eye pathology is a serious concern for astronauts who spend time in deep space. Microgravity is a major component of the spaceflight environment which could have adverse effects on ocular health. The use of centrifugation to exert forces that partially or fully mimic Earth-level gravity in space is a possible countermeasure to mitigate the effects of microgravity on the eye. Therefore, we subjected mice on the International Space Station (ISS) to microgravity (0 G) or artificial gravity by centrifugation at 0.33 G, 0.67 G, and 1 G, and then performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on optic nerve and retinal tissue after returning them to Earth alive. We find that the microgravity environment induces transcriptomic changes in the optic nerve and retina consistent with an increased oxidative stress load, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. We also find that adding artificial gravity on board the ISS attenuates the transcriptomic response to microgravity in a dose-dependent manner. Such attenuation may effectively protect from and mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissue.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Human exploration of the solar system will expose crew members to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), with a potential for adverse health effects. GCR particles (protons and ions) move at nearly the speed of light and easily penetrate space station walls, as well as the human body. Previously, we have shown reactivation of latent herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus, Varicella zoster virus, Epstein–Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (CMV), during stays at the International Space Station. Given the prevalence of latent CMV and the known propensity of space radiation to cause alterations in many cellular processes, we undertook this study to understand the role of GCR in reactivating latent CMV. Latently infected Kasumi cells with CMV were irradiated with 137Cs gamma rays, 150 MeV protons, 600 MeV/n carbon ions, 600 MeV/n iron ions, proton ions, and simulated GCR. The CMV copy number increased significantly in the cells exposed to radiation as compared with the non-irradiated controls. Viral genome sequencing did not reveal significant nucleotide differences among the compared groups. However, transcriptome analysis showed the upregulation of transcription of the UL49 ORF, implicating it in the switch from latent to lytic replication. These findings support our hypothesis that GCR may be a strong contributor to the reactivation of CMV infection seen in ISS crew members.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: UNC-89 is a giant sarcomeric M-line protein required for sarcomere organization and optimal muscle function. UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: The ISS rodent habitat has provided crucial insights into the impact of spaceflight on mammals, inducing symptoms characteristic of liver disease, insulin resistance, osteopenia, and myopathy. Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.

PARÁGRAFO: Stem cell research performed in space has provided fundamental insights into stem cell properties and behavior in microgravity including cell proliferation, differentiation, and regeneration capabilities. However, there is broader scientific value to this research including potential translation of stem cell research in space to clinical applications. Here, we present important discoveries from different studies performed in space demonstrating the potential use of human stem cells as well as the limitations in cellular therapeutics. A full understanding of the effects of microgravity in space on potentially supporting the expansion and/or enhancement of stem cell function is required to translate the findings into clinics.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Natural killer (NK) cells are an important first-line of defense against malignant cells. Because of the potential for increased cancer risk from astronaut exposure to space radiation, we determined whether microgravity present during spaceflight affects the body’s defenses against leukemogenesis. Human NK cells were cultured for 48 h under normal gravity and simulated microgravity (sμG), and cytotoxicity against K-562 (CML) and MOLT-4 (T-ALL) cells was measured using standard methodology or under continuous sμG. This brief exposure to sμG markedly reduced NK cytotoxicity against both leukemias, and these deleterious effects were more pronounced in continuous sμG. RNA-seq performed on NK cells from two additional healthy donors provided insight into the mechanism(s) by which sμG reduced cytotoxicity. Given our prior report of space radiation-induced human T-ALL in vivo, the reduced cytotoxicity against MOLT-4 is striking and raises the possibility that μG may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged missions beyond LEO.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Microgravity exposure induces a cephalad fluid shift and an overall reduction in physical activity levels which can lead to cardiovascular deconditioning in the absence of countermeasures. Future spaceflight missions will expose crew to extended periods of microgravity among other stressors, the effects of which on cardiovascular health are not fully known. In this study, we determined cardiac responses to extended microgravity exposure using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. We hypothesized that exposure to prolonged simulated microgravity and subsequent recovery would lead to increased oxidative damage and altered expression of genes involved in the oxidative response. To test this hypothesis, we examined hearts of male (three and nine months of age) and female (3 months of age) Long–Evans rats that underwent HU for various durations up to 90 days and reambulated up to 90 days post-HU. Results indicate sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression in left ventricular tissue. Three-month-old females displayed elevated 8-OHdG levels after 14 days of HU while age-matched males did not. In nine-month-old males, there were no differences in 8-OHdG levels between HU and normally loaded control males at any of the timepoints tested following HU. RNAseq analysis of left ventricular tissue from nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation and differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. Taken together, these findings provide a rationale for targeting antioxidant and immune pathways and that sex differences should be taken into account in the development of countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health in space.

TÍTULO: Abstract
PARÁGRAFO: Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak.
